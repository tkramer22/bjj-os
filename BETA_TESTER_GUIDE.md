## 🧪 What to Test

### ✅ Test 1: Ask Prof. OS Questions

Try asking about techniques you're working on:

**Sample Questions:**
- "How do I finish a triangle choke?"
- "What's the best way to pass spider guard?"
- "How do I escape side control?"
- "I'm competing next month, what should I drill?"
- "Show me guard retention fundamentals"

**What to look for:**
- ✅ Does Prof. OS give helpful, personalized answers?
- ✅ Are **video recommendations** relevant to your question?
- ✅ Do you see **2+ video cards** with each answer?
- ✅ Are the instructors credible (Roger Gracie, Marcelo Garcia, Gordon Ryan, etc.)?
- ✅ Does the coaching sound knowledgeable?

### ✅ Test 2: Watch & Save Videos

**Steps:**
1. Ask a question (e.g., "armbar from mount")
2. Prof. OS recommends 2+ videos
3. **Tap the play button (▶)** on a video card
4. **Verify:** Video plays INSIDE the app (not redirecting to YouTube)
5. **Close the video** (X button, tap outside, or press Escape)
6. **Tap the save button (bookmark icon)** on a video
7. **Navigate to "Saved" tab** (bottom navigation)
8. **Verify:** Your saved video appears
9. **Unsave it** by tapping bookmark again

## 🚨 Known Issues (We're Working On It)

- **First message might take 5-10 seconds** - AI warming up
- **Some videos might have NULL quality scores** - This is normal, we're still scoring them
- **Test cache issue** - If you see old messages from "hours ago," clear browser storage or use incognito

**If you hit any of these, it's expected. Still let me know if it's annoying!**
