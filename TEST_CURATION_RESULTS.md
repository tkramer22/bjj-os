## 🎯 7-DIMENSIONAL ALGORITHM IN ACTION

**Example Video:** "K Guard system"

**Dimension Scores:**
- [D1] Instructor: 40/100 (unknown instructor)
- [D2] Taxonomy: 40/100 (not in instructor database)
- [D3] Coverage: 25/50 (gap boost applied)
- [D4] Uniqueness: 80/100 (unique content)
- [D6] Belt Level: 70/100 (appropriate difficulty)
- [D7] Emerging: 0/100 (not trending technique)

**Final Score:** 81.5/100
**Decision:** ❌ REJECT
**Reason:** "Instructor credibility too low (40/60 required)"

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS FROM TEST

### **Why Videos Were Rejected:**

1. **Unknown Instructors (Most Common)**
   - System requires 60/100 minimum instructor credibility
   - Unknown instructors score 40/100
   - Elite instructor targeting prevents low-quality content

2. **Too Short (Duration Filter)**
   - Many videos <70 seconds (shorts, clips, teasers)
   - Automatic skip saves API quota
   - Focuses analysis on full instructionals

3. **Failed Stage Analysis**
   - Some pass Stage 1 (instructional detection)
   - Some fail Stage 2 (key detail depth)
   - Some fail Stage 3 (instructor credibility)
   - 7D evaluation catches remaining issues

### **What This Means:**

✅ **High Quality Bar:** Only elite instructional content passes
✅ **Elite Targeting:** Prioritizes known, credible instructors
✅ **Quota Efficiency:** Skips shorts/clips before expensive analysis
✅ **Comprehensive Vetting:** Multi-stage + 7D ensures quality
