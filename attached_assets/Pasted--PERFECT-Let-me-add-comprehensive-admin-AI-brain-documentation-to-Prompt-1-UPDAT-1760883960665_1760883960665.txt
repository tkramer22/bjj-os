- After AI identifies instructor, what happens?
  - Query instructor_credibility table?
  - If known instructor:
    - Use their quality threshold (6.5, 7.0, or 7.5)
    - Check if video quality >= threshold
    - If yes → approve
    - If no → reject
  - If unknown instructor:
    - Check instructor rank (black belt?)
    - Check quality score (7.5+ for black belt, 8.5+ for others?)
