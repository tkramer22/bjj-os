FIX BELT GRAPHIC - FINAL CORRECT VERSION WITH COLOR ROTATION STARTING ON WHITE

The belt is STILL WRONG. Here's exactly what it needs to be:

BELT STRUCTURE (ALL RANKS):

Left Side (90% width):
- Solid color based on belt rank
- NO border (except white and black belts - see below)

Right Side (10% width):
- Pure BLACK #000000 for White/Blue/Purple/Brown belts
- Pure RED #DC2626 for Black belt only
- NO WHITE BORDER around the black/red section
- The black/red section has NO border at all

Stripes:
- 4 white vertical stripes
- ONLY on the black/red section (right 10%)
- Each stripe runs the FULL HEIGHT of the belt (top to bottom, no margins)
- Stripe width: 3px each
- Evenly spaced across the black/red section
- White #FFFFFF color
- Look like tape wrapped vertically around belt

CORRECT STRUCTURE:
[BLUE COLOR 90%][BLACK 10% with 4 white vertical lines full height]

NOT THIS:
[BLUE COLOR 90%][WHITE BORDER + BLACK + WHITE BORDER with stripes]

DIMENSIONS:
- Total width: 500px
- Total height: 80px
- Left section (colored): 450px wide
- Right section (black/red): 50px wide
- Stripes: 3px wide × 80px tall (FULL HEIGHT, no top/bottom margins)

COLORS FOR EACH RANK:

1. WHITE BELT:
   Left: #FFFFFF (450px) - ADD 2px gray border #333333 around entire belt so it shows on dark background
   Right: #FFFFFF (50px) - no stripes visible (white on white)

2. BLUE BELT:
   Left: #2563EB (450px) - no border needed
   Right: #000000 (50px) - NO border, just pure black with 4 white stripes

3. PURPLE BELT:
   Left: #7C3AED (450px) - no border needed
   Right: #000000 (50px) - NO border, just pure black with 4 white stripes

4. BROWN BELT:
   Left: #92400E (450px) - no border needed
   Right: #000000 (50px) - NO border, just pure black with 4 white stripes

5. BLACK BELT:
   Left: #000000 (450px) - ADD 2px white border #FFFFFF around left section only so it shows on dark background
   Right: #DC2626 red (50px) - NO border, just pure red with 4 white stripes

ANIMATED COLOR ROTATION (LANDING PAGE ONLY):

On landing page, belt automatically cycles through all 5 ranks:
- START with WHITE belt (page loads showing white)
- After 2 seconds → BLUE belt
- After 2 seconds → PURPLE belt
- After 2 seconds → BROWN belt
- After 2 seconds → BLACK belt
- After 2 seconds → loop back to WHITE belt
- Continuous loop, never stops

Smooth transition:
- Fade transition between colors (0.5 second fade)
- Both the left colored section AND right stripe section change together
- White → Blue → Purple → Brown → Black → White (repeat)

Animation sequence:
```

0s: START with White belt (white left, white right, no visible stripes)
2s: Fade to Blue belt (blue left, black right, white stripes)
4s: Fade to Purple belt (purple left, black right, white stripes)
6s: Fade to Brown belt (brown left, black right, white stripes)
8s: Fade to Black belt (black left, red right, white stripes)
10s: Fade back to White belt (loop restarts)

```
CRITICAL: When page loads, the FIRST belt shown must be WHITE belt. Not blue, not any other color. WHITE first.

Where color rotation happens:
- Landing page ONLY: Animated rotation starting with WHITE, cycling through all 5 belts
- All other pages: Static belt showing user's actual rank (no rotation)

FIX IMMEDIATELY:
1. Remove white border from black/red section (it should be pure black or pure red with NO border)
2. Make stripes run FULL HEIGHT of belt (80px tall, touching top and bottom edges)
3. Implement 2-second color rotation on landing page STARTING WITH WHITE
4. Keep smooth fade transitions between belt colors
5. Loop continuously (White → Blue → Purple → Brown → Black → White repeat)
6. First belt visible on page load = WHITE

The black section on the right should be PURE BLACK with NO BORDER AROUND IT. Only the 4 white stripes are visible on the black section.

STARTING COLOR = WHITE BELT (not blue)
