You’re right on both counts. Let me give you prompts for both issues:

TWO URGENT ISSUES TO FIX

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ISSUE #1: GEMINI BACKLOG - 364 VIDEOS UNPROCESSED
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

We have 364 videos (21%) sitting in the Gemini queue unprocessed. This should be 0.

CHECK IMMEDIATELY:
1. Is the Gemini batch job actually running?
2. Are both API keys active and working?
3. Is there an error blocking processing?
4. When was the last successful Gemini extraction?

FIX:
1. If batch job stopped - restart it immediately
2. If rate limited - confirm auto-retry is working
3. Process ALL 364 pending videos NOW
4. Run in parallel dual-key turbo mode

Show me:
- Current Gemini job status
- Last successful processing timestamp
- Any errors in the logs
- Estimated time to clear the 364 backlog

DO NOT STOP until pending = 0

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ISSUE #2: CURATION IS UNDERPERFORMING - USE THE OPTIMIZED VERSION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Only +9 videos added is too low. We had a curation approach that was adding 30-50+ videos per run.

CHECK:
1. Which curation script/function was just used?
2. Is it using the OPTIMIZED curation (run-optimized-curation.ts)?
3. What was the success rate on previous high-performing runs?

THE HIGH-PERFORMING CURATION should:
- Search by elite instructor channels (not just keywords)
- Use trusted instructor list for quality boost
- Accept videos scoring 7.0+ from trusted instructors
- Accept videos scoring 7.5+ from others
- Run parallel searches
- Mine entire channel histories, not just recent

RUN THE OPTIMIZED CURATION NOW with these specific channels:
- Bernardo Faria BJJ (channel deep dive)
- Lachlan Giles (channel deep dive)
- BJJ Fanatics (channel deep dive)
- Knight Jiu-Jitsu (channel deep dive)
- John Danaher (all content)
- Chewjitsu (channel deep dive)
- Jon Thomas BJJ (channel deep dive)

These channels have HUNDREDS of quality instructional videos. We should be pulling 50+ per run, not 9.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PRIORITY: 
1. FIRST - Get Gemini processing the 364 backlog NOW
2. SECOND - Run optimized curation to add more videos
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Report status on both within 5 minutes.
