That’s the right approach. Fix first, verify at 95%+, then human test.

**Here’s the master prompt for your approval:**

```
PROFESSOR OS PERSONALITY + VIDEO ACCURACY OVERHAUL

We need Professor OS responses to feel like texting a real coach, not ChatGPT with BJJ paint. Fix all issues and run a verification test.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PART 1: CONVERSATION PERSONALITY FIXES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. REMOVE "TRAINING PARTNER"
- Delete from system prompt entirely
- Use user's actual name only 5% of responses, for emphasis
- Example: "You got this, Todd" on a breakthrough moment
- Otherwise: no name, just talk naturally

2. RESPONSE LENGTH BY INTENT (not word count)
Detect intent and match response:

| Intent | Example message | Response length |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Greeting | "hey" "what's up" | 1-2 sentences |
| Quick question | "show me triangles" | 2-3 sentences + video |
| Troubleshoot | "hip bump not working" | 3-4 sentences + video |
| Emotional | "got smashed today" | Empathy + 3-4 sentences |
| Strategy | "what should I focus on" | 4-6 sentences max |
| Deep dive (they ask) | "explain more" "why?" | Can go longer |

DEFAULT: 400-600 characters. Only exceed for emotional support or when user explicitly asks for depth.

3. QUOTE USER'S VOCABULARY BACK
- Store summarized phrases with their language in profile
- Example storage: { struggle: "getting smashed in half guard", their_word: "smashed" }
- Claude references naturally: "You said you keep getting smashed in half guard - that's usually the underhook"
- NOT: "We discussed half guard issues previously"

4. VARY ENDINGS
Remove formulaic "How's that feeling?" from every response.

Mix:
- 30% questions: "What happened when you tried it?"
- 25% challenges: "Try it Tuesday. Report back."
- 25% confidence: "You got this."
- 20% anticipation: "This is gonna click soon."

5. STORE COMMUNICATION STYLE IN PROFILE
Add to user profile:

```json
{
  "communication_style": {
    "avg_message_length": number,
    "follow_up_rate": 0.0-1.0,
    "prefers_videos": true/false,
    "vocabulary_notes": ["smashed", "stuck", etc]
  }
}
```

Track automatically over time. Inject into Claude context:
“User typically sends brief messages. Follow-up rate is low. Be concise.”

1. STRIP MARKDOWN FORMATTING

- No **bold text**
- No bullet points in responses
- No headers
- Write like a text message, not a blog post

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PART 2: COMBAT SPORTS INTELLIGENCE FIX
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PROBLEM: Tests showed “pass” but actual responses said “I don’t have access to recent ADCC results”

The scraper exists but ISN’T delivering data to Claude.

FIX:

1. Trace the combat sports data flow end-to-end
1. Show me: Where is scraper called? What does it return? Is it injected into prompt?
1. Find the broken connection
1. Fix it
1. Test with: “Who won ADCC 2024?” - response MUST include real names (Gordon Ryan, Mica Galvao, etc.)

If scraper hasn’t run recently:

- Run it now
- Store results
- Inject into Professor OS context

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PART 3: VIDEO ACCURACY VERIFICATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

When Professor OS recommends a video, verify:

|Check               |Rule                                             |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|Technique match     |Hip bump question → hip bump video               |
|Position match      |Closed guard question → closed guard video       |
|Instructor match    |Mentions “Danaher” → serves Danaher video        |
|Level appropriate   |Blue belt → fundamentals, not advanced           |
|Gi/No-gi match      |User trains gi → gi video priority               |
|Attack/Defense match|“Getting passed” → guard retention, not passing  |
|Video exists        |Only serve videos that exist in our 724 library  |
|Timestamp accuracy  |If timestamp given, verify it shows the technique|

ADD DIAGNOSTIC:
For each video recommendation, log:

```json
{
  "question_intent": "troubleshoot",
  "technique_requested": "hip bump",
  "video_served": {
    "title": "...",
    "instructor": "...",
    "technique_tags": [...],
    "match_score": 0.0-1.0
  },
  "match_reasons": ["technique_match", "instructor_mentioned", etc]
}
```

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PART 4: VERIFICATION TEST (100 questions)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Run 100 test questions across these categories:

PERSONALITY (40 questions):

- 10 greetings/casual → verify short responses
- 10 technique questions → verify video + concise response
- 10 troubleshooting → verify diagnosis + video
- 10 emotional/frustration → verify empathy, appropriate length

VIDEO ACCURACY (30 questions):

- 10 specific technique requests → verify correct technique video
- 10 instructor-specific requests → verify correct instructor video
- 10 defensive vs offensive → verify attack/defense match

COMBAT SPORTS (15 questions):

- 5 ADCC questions → must return real data
- 5 IBJJF questions → must return real data
- 5 competitor questions → must return real info

MEMORY/PERSONALIZATION (15 questions):

- 5 referencing past conversation → verify vocabulary callback
- 5 asking about their profile → verify personalization
- 5 asking for recommendations → verify body type / level match

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PART 5: SCORING CRITERIA
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Each response scored on:

|Criteria             |Pass                             |Fail                               |
|---------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
|No “Training Partner”|✅                                |Contains “Training Partner”        |
|Correct length       |Within intent range              |Too long or too short              |
|No markdown          |Plain text                       |Contains **bold** or bullets       |
|Ending variety       |Not a question (unless 30% quota)|Formulaic question ending          |
|Video accuracy       |Technique/instructor match       |Wrong video or no video when needed|
|Combat sports        |Real data when asked             |“I don’t have access”              |
|Memory callback      |Uses their vocabulary            |Generic reference                  |

MINIMUM PASS RATE: 95% in each category
