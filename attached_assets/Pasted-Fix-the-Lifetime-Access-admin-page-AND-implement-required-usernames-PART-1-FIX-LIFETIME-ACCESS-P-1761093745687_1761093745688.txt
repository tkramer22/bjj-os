Fix the Lifetime Access admin page AND implement required usernames:

PART 1 - FIX LIFETIME ACCESS PAGE:

1. ENABLE ACTION BUTTONS:
- Eye icon: Opens user detail view (shows full profile, sessions, activity)
- Edit icon: Opens edit modal to modify user details
- X icon: Soft delete/hide user (mark as deleted, don't show in list)

2. AUTO-ENABLE LIFETIME BYPASS:
When an admin grants lifetime access to a user, automatically set their "lifetime_bypass" field to TRUE in the database. This prevents subscription conflicts.

3. ADD BULK ACTIONS:
- "Hide Test Users" button to filter out users with reason: "Beta Tester", "Bulk Test", "Test", "Automated test"
- "Delete Selected" checkbox system to bulk remove fake accounts

4. ADD CONFIRMATION DIALOGS:
- Before deleting: "Are you sure you want to remove this user's lifetime access?"
- Show username and phone number in confirmation

PART 2 - IMPLEMENT REQUIRED USERNAMES:

1. UPDATE SIGNUP FLOW:
Add username field as REQUIRED during signup, right after SMS verification.

Step 1: Enter phone number
Step 2: Verify SMS code
Step 3: Enter display name (required) - "What should we call you?"
Step 4: Select belt level
Step 5: Complete - enter app

2. USERNAME VALIDATION & SUGGESTIONS:
- Convert user input to username format: "John Smith" → "john_smith"
- Check if username exists in database
- If taken, automatically suggest alternatives:
  * [username]_bjj (e.g., john_smith_bjj)
  * [username]_[random 2-digit number] (e.g., john_smith_47)
  * [first initial][last name] (e.g., jsmith)
  * [first name]_[last initial] (e.g., john_s)
- Show these 4 suggestions in real-time
- Allow user to type custom username if they don't like suggestions
- Re-validate custom input before allowing signup

3. USERNAME RULES:
- Lowercase only
- Alphanumeric + underscores only
- 3-20 characters
- No spaces
- Must be unique across all users

4. DATABASE UPDATES:
- Add "username" column to users table (VARCHAR, UNIQUE, NOT NULL)
- Add "display_name" column for the original input (e.g., "John Smith")
- Backfill existing users: set username = "user_[user_id]" for any unnamed accounts

5. ADMIN DASHBOARD DISPLAY:
- Show display_name in all admin panels (not "Unnamed")
- Show @username as secondary identifier
- Update Lifetime Access page to display: "John Smith (@john_smith)"

6. PROF. OS INTEGRATION:
- Use display_name in all Prof. OS conversations
- Example: "Hey John, based on your last session..." (not "Hey user_12345...")

Make all these changes cohesive and production-ready.
