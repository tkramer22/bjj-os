Same errors in the console — “TO JS undefined” sandwiching the Haptics notification call. Replit didn’t actually wrap them in try/catch properly.
Don’t remove haptics entirely — just tell Replit to remove them from delete and update specifically, and fix the wrapper for everything else. Quick surgical fix:

HAPTICS ARE STILL BREAKING DELETE AND UPDATE — FIX NOW

The Xcode console still shows "TO JS undefined" when tapping Delete.
The previous fix did not work. The haptic calls are still crashing 
the delete and update handlers.

DO THIS EXACTLY:

1. Find the delete session handler function
2. REMOVE the Haptics call from it completely. No haptic on delete.
3. Find the update session handler function  
4. REMOVE the Haptics call from it completely. No haptic on update.

Delete and update should have ZERO haptic code in them. None.

5. For ALL other haptic calls in the Training tab, replace the 
   import and every call with this pattern:

   // At the top of the file
   let safeHaptic = async () => {};
   let safeNotification = async () => {};
   
   try {
     const { Haptics, ImpactStyle, NotificationType } = await import('@capacitor/haptics');
     safeHaptic = async (style) => {
       try { await Haptics.impact({ style }); } catch(e) {}
     };
     safeNotification = async (type) => {
       try { await Haptics.notification({ type }); } catch(e) {}
     };
   } catch(e) {
     // Haptics not available
   }

   Then use safeHaptic(ImpactStyle.Light) everywhere instead of 
   Haptics.impact() directly.

6. The delete handler should be simply:
   - Call DELETE API
   - On success: close bottom sheet, refresh calendar
   - That's it. No haptics. No extras.

7. The update handler should be simply:
   - Call PUT API
   - On success: close bottom sheet, refresh calendar
   - That's it. No haptics. No extras.

TEST:
□ Delete works — session removed, sheet closes, calendar updates
□ Update works — session updated, sheet closes
□ No "TO JS undefined" in Xcode console
□ Other haptics (mood chips, save button) still work

THIS IS BLOCKING APP STORE SUBMISSION. Fix this first.
