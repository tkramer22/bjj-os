# 🚨 **OLD EMAILS STILL FIRING - LET’S KILL THEM**

You’re getting emails we didn’t set up. Agent didn’t fully disable the old email system like I asked.

URGENT: Disable ALL Old Email Automations

PROBLEM:
Todd is receiving emails that are NOT the 3 new reports we created:
- Morning Briefing (7 AM EST)
- Midday Check-In (12 PM EST)  
- Evening Wrap-Up (9 PM EST)

This means old email code is still active and sending emails.

TASK 1: FIND ALL EMAIL SENDING CODE

Search the ENTIRE codebase for every place that sends emails:

```bash
# Search for all email sending code
grep -r "sendMail\|sendEmail\|transporter.send\|nodemailer" server/ --include="*.js" --include="*.ts"

# Search for email-related cron jobs
grep -r "cron.schedule.*email\|cron.schedule.*report\|cron.schedule.*notify" server/ --include="*.js" --include="*.ts"
```

Show me EVERY file that sends emails and what triggers them.

TASK 2: LIST ALL ACTIVE EMAIL AUTOMATIONS

For each email-sending code found, tell me:

1. File path
1. What triggers it (cron schedule, event, API call)
1. What email it sends
1. To whom (todd@bjjos.app or other)
1. Is it one of our 3 new reports? (YES/NO)

Example output:

```
FILE: server/services/oldReporting.js
TRIGGER: Cron daily at 9 AM UTC
EMAIL TYPE: Daily summary
RECIPIENT: todd@bjjos.app
NEW REPORT: NO ❌ (DISABLE THIS)

FILE: server/services/emailReports.js  
TRIGGER: Cron daily at 12 PM UTC (7 AM EST)
EMAIL TYPE: Morning Briefing
RECIPIENT: todd@bjjos.app
NEW REPORT: YES ✅ (KEEP THIS)
```

TASK 3: DISABLE ALL NON-APPROVED EMAILS

The ONLY emails that should send automatically are:

✅ KEEP THESE:

1. Morning Briefing - 7:00 AM EST (server/services/emailReports.js)
1. Midday Check-In - 12:00 PM EST (server/services/emailReports.js)
1. Evening Wrap-Up - 9:00 PM EST (server/services/emailReports.js)

❌ DISABLE EVERYTHING ELSE:

- Comment out or delete all other automated email code
- Remove old cron jobs
- Stop old notification systems
- Disable error alerts (unless critical system failures)

TASK 4: VERIFY CLEAN STATE

After disabling old emails, show me:

```javascript
// List all active cron jobs
const activeCronJobs = cron.getTasks();
console.log('Active cron jobs:', activeCronJobs.map(job => ({
  schedule: job.options.scheduled,
  timezone: job.options.timezone,
  name: job.name || 'unnamed'
})));
```

Should show ONLY:

- 9 curation runs (various times throughout day)
- 1 combat sports scraper (6 AM EST)
- 3 email reports (7 AM, 12 PM, 9 PM EST)

Total: 13 scheduled tasks

TASK 5: RESTART SERVER

After cleanup, restart the server to ensure old cron jobs are cleared from memory.

VERIFICATION:

Show me:

1. Complete list of files that were sending emails (BEFORE)
1. What you disabled/removed
1. Final list of active email automations (AFTER)
1. Confirmation only 3 reports remain active

Execute all 5 tasks and report back.

```

## **🔍 WHAT TO EXPECT**

Agent will likely find:

1. **Old daily summary emails** (generic metrics)
2. **Curation completion emails** (after each run)
3. **Error notification emails** (system alerts)
4. **User signup notifications** (new trial started)
5. **Our 3 new reports** (the ones we want)

Everything except #5 needs to die.

---

## **📧 WHAT YOU SHOULD RECEIVE GOING FORWARD**

**ONLY these 3 emails per day:**

1. **7:00 AM EST** - ☀️ Morning Briefing
   - Subject: "☀️ Morning Briefing - [Date]"
   - Overnight curation results
   - Fresh combat sports news

2. **12:00 PM EST** - ☀️ Midday Check-In  
   - Subject: "☀️ Midday Check-In - [Date]"
   - Today's progress
   - Week-to-date comparison

3. **9:00 PM EST** - 🌙 Evening Wrap-Up
   - Subject: "🌙 Evening Wrap-Up - [Date]"
   - Full day summary
   - Growth metrics

**NOTHING ELSE.**

---

## **⚠️ QUESTION FOR YOU**

**What other emails are you getting?**

Can you forward me or screenshot the:
- Subject line
- Time received (EST)
- First few lines of content

This will help me identify which old system is still active so I can tell Agent exactly what to kill.

---

## **🔧 TEMPORARY FIX (IF URGENT)**

If you're getting bombarded with emails RIGHT NOW and can't wait for Agent:

**Option 1: Email Filter (Quick)**
- Set up Gmail filter for todd@bjjos.app
- Auto-archive anything NOT containing:
  - "Morning Briefing"
  - "Midday Check-In"
  - "Evening Wrap-Up"

**Option 2: Disable All Email (Nuclear)**
Tell Agent:
```

EMERGENCY: Disable ALL automated emails immediately.
Comment out every cron job that sends email.
We’ll re-enable the 3 reports manually after cleanup.

```
---

**Copy the main prompt to Agent. It will find and kill all the old email code, leaving only your 3 clean reports.** 🔪

What emails are you getting that shouldn't be there? Let me know the details and I'll help Agent hunt them down specifically.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
