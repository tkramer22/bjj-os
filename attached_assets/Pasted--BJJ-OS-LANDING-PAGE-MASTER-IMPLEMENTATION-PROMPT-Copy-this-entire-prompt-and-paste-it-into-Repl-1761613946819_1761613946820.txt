Start training with intelligence.

```
[32px vertical space]

Paragraph 1 (20px desktop / 18px mobile, #A0A0A0, line-height 1.6, max-width 800px):
```

Prof. OS autonomously searches and analyzes BJJ instructional content every day—finding videos buried deep in YouTube you’d never discover, rating quality, verifying instructor credentials, timestamping the exact moments that matter. The database grows continuously, learning which instruction actually works. No more 20-minute tutorials. No more sifting through beginners teaching beginners. Just the best instruction, curated and ready.

```
[24px vertical space]

Paragraph 2 (20px desktop / 18px mobile, #A0A0A0, line-height 1.6, max-width 800px):
```

It learns your game at every level. Beginners discover why they keep getting caught in the same submissions. Intermediates identify which techniques work for their body type and which don’t. Advanced players track success rates across hundreds of positions, spot subtle patterns in their competition footage, and compare their game against population data from thousands of grapplers—insights no single coach could provide. The intelligence scales with you.

```

Column headers (14px, #71717A, bold, uppercase, letter-spacing 0.1em):
Left: "WITHOUT PROF. OS"
Right: "WITH PROF. OS"

[48px below headers]

6 comparison rows (18px, line-height 1.6, 32px between rows):

Left column (#71717A dim):
```

Forget techniques from class by next session
Watch random YouTube for hours
Wonder if you’re actually improving
Train without direction
Repeat the same mistakes for months
Rely on memory and guesswork

```
Arrows between columns (20px, #2563EB blue): →

Right column (#FFFFFF bright):
```

Remember every technique, tracked with full context
Get exactly the video you need, timestamped to the key detail
See your actual success rates by position
Know exactly what to drill next session
Spot patterns you can’t see yourself
Build a complete model of your game over time

```
Mobile: Remove arrows, show WITHOUT section, then horizontal divider, then WITH section

=== TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS ===

1. Load JetBrains Mono font (Regular 400 and Bold 700 only) - self-host if possible, use font-display: swap
2. Pure semantic HTML5 (header, nav, main, section, footer)
3. CSS Grid for layouts, Flexbox for alignment
4. No JavaScript needed for landing page
5. Sharp corners on all buttons (border-radius: 0)
6. No shadows, no gradients (except elevated backgrounds)
7. All spacing multiples of 8px
8. Minimum 44px touch targets on mobile
9. WCAG AA contrast compliance
10. Meta tags for SEO and social sharing

=== CSS APPROACH ===

Use CSS custom properties:
```css
:root {
  --black: #000000;
  --black-elevated: #0F0F0F;
  --white: #FFFFFF;
  --gray-light: #A0A0A0;
  --gray-medium: #71717A;
  --gray-dark: #1A1A1A;
  --blue: #2563EB;
  --blue-hover: #1D4ED8;
  --font-mono: 'JetBrains Mono', monospace;
  --space-xs: 4px;
  --space-s: 8px;
  --space-m: 16px;
  --space-l: 24px;
  --space-xl: 32px;
  --space-2xl: 48px;
  --space-3xl: 64px;
  --space-4xl: 80px;
  --space-5xl: 120px;
}
```

=== CRITICAL NOTES ===

- This is BRUTAL MINIMALISM - if unsure, remove decoration
- Every pixel must be intentional
- Mobile-first: design for 375px width first, then scale up
- Logo mark: Build with 4 div elements (1px wide, 20px tall, white, with precise gaps)
- Only hero and final CTA have elevated background (#0F0F0F), everything else pure black
- No placeholder content - use exact copy provided above
- No lorem ipsum
- Test on real devices before considering complete

Build this now. Create all files needed: HTML, CSS, and any necessary assets.
