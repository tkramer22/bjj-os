URGENT FIXES - 3 Critical Issues to Resolve

Read all three issues before making any changes.

ISSUE 1: VIDEO THUMBNAILS NOT LOADING

The video thumbnails are showing gray placeholder boxes instead of actual YouTube thumbnails.

FIX:
1. Check the YouTube thumbnail URL format - ensure you're using the correct YouTube thumbnail URL pattern:
   - https://img.youtube.com/vi/[VIDEO_ID]/maxresdefault.jpg
   - Fallback to: https://img.youtube.com/vi/[VIDEO_ID]/hqdefault.jpg
   - Second fallback to: https://img.youtube.com/vi/[VIDEO_ID]/mqdefault.jpg

2. Add error handling for failed thumbnail loads - if thumbnail fails, show a branded fallback image (dark background with BJJ OS logo or a generic mat texture)

3. Check if video IDs are being extracted correctly from YouTube URLs stored in database

4. Add lazy loading and caching for thumbnails to prevent rate limiting

5. Test with multiple videos to confirm fix works

ISSUE 2: COUNTDOWN TEXT IN PROFESSOR OS RESPONSES

Professor OS is including trial countdown text in coaching responses like:
"(6 days left - drill these tonight)"

This breaks the coaching experience and feels salesy.

FIX:
1. Find where this countdown text is being injected into Professor OS responses
2. REMOVE all countdown/trial references from Professor OS system prompt and response generation
3. Trial countdown should ONLY appear in:
   - A subtle UI element (header, footer, or account page)
   - A separate notification banner
   - Settings/subscription page
4. Professor OS should NEVER mention trials, pricing, days left, or anything sales-related in coaching responses
5. Search codebase for "days left" and "drill these tonight" to find and remove

ISSUE 3: IRRELEVANT VIDEO SUGGESTIONS

User asked about ARMBARS but Professor OS suggested "Escaping Closed Guard with Gordon Ryan" which is completely unrelated.

FIX:
1. Review video matching/recommendation logic
2. Ensure video suggestions are filtered by:
   - Primary technique mentioned (armbar, guard pass, sweep, etc.)
   - Position context (mount, guard, side control, etc.)
   - Only return videos where technique tags MATCH the user query
3. Add stricter relevance scoring - videos must match the PRIMARY technique requested
4. If no highly relevant videos exist, say so rather than suggesting loosely related content
5. Test by asking "How do I finish an armbar from mount?" and verify ONLY armbar videos are returned

PRIORITY ORDER:
1. Fix thumbnails first (most visible bug)
2. Remove countdown from Professor OS (breaks user trust)
3. Fix video relevance (affects core product value)

Test all three fixes before confirming complete.
