I can still see “To Native → Haptics Impact” and “TO JS undefined” at the bottom of the console. Haptics were NOT fully removed — there’s still at least one haptic call firing somewhere, possibly outside the Training tab (maybe in a shared component or the chat system triggering on app load).
But more importantly, looking at the console there’s also “Failed to change to usage state 2: (null)” which could be a separate issue blocking the delete.
Let me try a different approach. Instead of fighting haptics, let’s diagnose the actual delete:

DELETE SESSION IS STILL BROKEN — DIAGNOSE AND FIX

Haptics removal from Training tab did not fix the delete.
There may be a separate issue.

DO THIS IN ORDER:

1. Add console.log statements to the delete handler:

   console.log('DELETE: Button clicked');
   console.log('DELETE: Session ID:', sessionId);
   
   // Before API call
   console.log('DELETE: Calling API...');
   
   const response = await fetch(`/api/training/sessions/${sessionId}`, {
     method: 'DELETE'
   });
   
   console.log('DELETE: Response status:', response.status);
   console.log('DELETE: Response body:', await response.text());
   
   // After API call
   console.log('DELETE: Closing sheet...');

2. Also check: Is the delete button's onClick handler actually 
   wired up? It might be that the "Delete" red button has no 
   onClick at all, or it points to the wrong function.

3. Check if there is a confirmation dialog that is supposed to 
   appear but is failing silently. Maybe the flow is:
   Tap Delete → confirmation dialog → confirm → actual delete
   And the confirmation dialog is what's broken.

4. Check the console for ANY error when Delete is tapped. 
   Screenshot the Xcode console immediately after tapping Delete.

5. Also search the ENTIRE codebase (not just Training tab) for 
   remaining Haptics imports that might fire on state changes:
   grep -r "Haptics" client/src/ --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts"
   Show me every file that still has Haptics.

Show me the console.log output and the grep results. 
DO NOT try to fix yet — just diagnose and report back.
