**GOOD NEWS!** You already have a solid foundation. I can see the key features are in place:

✅ Multi-factor AI scoring (Claude + user preferences + recency + duplicates)
✅ 90-day duplicate prevention
✅ Timestamped URLs (skips intros, starts at 30s)
✅ Personalization tracking
✅ Parallel video analysis

Now let’s **OPTIMIZE THE AI MODEL** to make it world-class. Tell Replit Agent:

Optimize the AI technique selection system to be best-in-class:

ENHANCED VIDEO SCORING CRITERIA:

1. **Instructor Credibility Score (0-40 points):**
   - World champion competitor: 40 points
   - Black belt with major wins: 30 points
   - Respected coach/instructor: 25 points
   - Known competitor: 20 points
   - Other: 10 points
   
   Priority instructors (auto 35+ points):
   John Danaher, Gordon Ryan, Lachlan Giles, Bernardo Faria, JT Torres, Craig Jones, Marcelo Garcia, Mikey Musumeci, Keenan Cornelius, Roger Gracie, Andre Galvao, Rafael Lovato Jr, Giancarlo Bodoni

2. **Key Detail Quality Score (0-30 points):**
   - Has SPECIFIC micro-adjustment (angle, timing, pressure, grip detail): 25-30 points
   - Has actionable detail but less specific: 15-20 points
   - General tip without specifics: 5-10 points
   - No clear detail: 0 points
   
   RED FLAGS (auto-reject):
   - "Just keep your elbows tight"
   - "Stay heavy on top"
   - "Control the position"
   - Generic advice without specifics

3. **Teaching Clarity Score (0-20 points):**
   - Clear demonstration + verbal explanation: 20 points
   - Good demo but unclear explanation: 12 points
   - Concept explained but poor demo: 10 points
   - Unclear: 0 points

4. **Production Quality Score (0-10 points):**
   - Clear audio + good camera angles: 10 points
   - Decent quality: 6 points
   - Poor quality: 0 points

TOTAL SCORE: Must be 80+ points to send (out of 100)

PERSONALIZATION LOGIC:

**Belt Level Matching:**
- White belt: Focus on fundamental positions, escapes, basic submissions
- Blue belt: Intermediate techniques, combinations, position maintenance
- Purple+: Advanced details, competition strategies, complex sequences

**Style Matching:**
- Gi: Prioritize grip-based techniques, collar chokes, lapel guards
- No-Gi: Prioritize wrestling, leg locks, body lock passing

**Focus Area Matching:**
- User says "guard": Prioritize guard retention, sweeps, attacks from guard
- User says "passing": Prioritize pressure passing, speed passing, leg drags
- User says "submissions": Prioritize finish details, entries, defenses

DUPLICATE PREVENTION ENHANCED:
- Track by technique NAME (e.g., "triangle choke") - no repeats for 90 days
- Track by instructor - max 1 technique per instructor per 30 days
- Track by position category - balance across guards, passes, submissions

DAILY SELECTION ALGORITHM:
1. Get user's belt level, style, focus areas
2. Query YouTube for high-quality channels
3. Analyze video transcripts with Claude for key details
4. Score each video using criteria above
5. Filter out duplicates (90 days technique, 30 days instructor)
6. Select highest scoring video that matches user preferences
7. Extract exact timestamp where key detail is explained
8. Format SMS with technique name, instructor, key detail, timestamped link

Make this AI selection system production-ready and implement all optimizations.
