I see two problems here:

1. **Still no back button/navigation header** - The previous prompt didn’t get implemented
1. **Wrong video recommendation** - User asked for triangle choke, got a cross collar choke from mount (completely different technique!)

Let me give you a combined fix prompt:

```
CRITICAL FIX: Two Issues - Navigation Header + Video Matching

=== ISSUE 1: MISSING NAVIGATION HEADER ===

The chat page has NO way to navigate back. Users are trapped.

ADD THIS HEADER to chat-mobile.tsx (or equivalent chat page):

1. Create fixed header at top of chat page:
   - Height: 64px
   - Background: #000000
   - Border-bottom: 1px solid #27272A
   - Position: fixed, top: 0, left: 0, right: 0
   - Z-index: 50

2. Header contents:
   - LEFT: Back arrow (ArrowLeft icon from lucide-react) 
     - onClick: navigate to /dashboard
     - Color: white, size 24px
     - Touch target: 48px minimum
   - CENTER: "Prof. OS" text with Brain icon
   - RIGHT: Optional menu icon (MoreVertical)

3. Add padding-top: 64px (or mt-16) to chat messages container so content doesn't hide behind header

=== ISSUE 2: VIDEO RECOMMENDATIONS ARE WRONG ===

User asked for "triangle choke" video but received "Cross Collar Choke from Mount" - completely different technique.

FIX THE VIDEO MATCHING LOGIC:

1. In the AI prompt or video search function, ensure EXACT technique matching:
   - "triangle choke" should ONLY return triangle choke videos
   - Do NOT substitute different techniques
   - If no exact match exists, say "I don't have a triangle choke video yet" and DO NOT recommend unrelated videos

2. Update the video search query logic:
   - Search should match technique_name or tags containing the requested technique
   - Use fuzzy matching for variations: "triangle", "triangle choke", "triangulo"
   - Do NOT return videos where the technique doesn't match

3. If no matching video found:
   - Provide text-based coaching on the technique (which it already does well)
   - Say "I'll add triangle choke videos to my list" 
   - Do NOT show an unrelated video as a substitute

VERIFY AFTER FIX:
- [ ] Chat page has visible header with back arrow
- [ ] Back arrow navigates to /dashboard
- [ ] Asking for "triangle choke" returns ONLY triangle choke videos (or none if unavailable)
- [ ] No more substituting unrelated techniques
```

The video mismatch is a big UX problem - it makes Prof. OS look broken when it recommends the wrong technique. Users will lose trust fast.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
