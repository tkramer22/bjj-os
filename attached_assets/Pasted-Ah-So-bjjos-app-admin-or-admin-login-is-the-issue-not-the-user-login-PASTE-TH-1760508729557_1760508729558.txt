Ah! So `bjjos.app/admin` (or `/admin/login`) is the issue, not the user login.

FIX ADMIN ROUTES - DIRECT URL NAVIGATION

When typing bjjos.app/admin or bjjos.app/admin/login directly in browser, getting "Did you forget to add the page to the router?" error.

PROBLEM: Server isn't serving the React app for /admin/* routes.

SOLUTION:

1. UPDATE SERVER CATCH-ALL ROUTE:
   The Express server needs to serve index.html for ALL routes including /admin/*
   
   In server.js or index.js, ensure this order:
   
   ```javascript
   // API routes (these should NOT return HTML)
   app.use('/api', apiRoutes);
   
   // Serve static files
   app.use(express.static('dist'));
   
   // CATCH-ALL for SPA routing (must be LAST)
   app.get('*', (req, res) => {
     res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'dist', 'index.html'));
   });
```

1. VERIFY ADMIN ROUTES IN WOUTER:
   Confirm these routes exist in the React router:

- /admin → redirects to /admin/dashboard
- /admin/login → AdminLogin component
- /admin/dashboard → AdminDashboard component

1. CHECK BUILD CONFIGURATION:

- Ensure React app is building correctly to /dist
- Ensure server is serving from /dist folder
- Verify no conflicting /admin static folder exists

1. TEST THESE URLS:
   After fix, all should work:

- bjjos.app/admin (redirects to dashboard)
- bjjos.app/admin/login (admin login page)
- bjjos.app/admin/dashboard (admin dashboard)
- bjjos.app/login (user login)
- bjjos.app/signup (user signup)

1. SHOW ME:

- The main server file (server/index.js or similar)
- Current route order in that file

Fix the server-side routing to serve index.html for all non-API routes, including /admin/*.

```

The issue is that when you type `/admin/login` directly in the browser:
1. Browser makes request to server
2. Server doesn't have that route configured
3. Returns error instead of index.html
4. React never loads, so Wouter never gets to handle the route
