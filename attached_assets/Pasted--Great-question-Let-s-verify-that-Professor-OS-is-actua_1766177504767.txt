**Great question.** Let’s verify that Professor OS is actually USING the Gemini-extracted data, not just storing it.

VERIFY: IS PROFESSOR OS USING THE GEMINI-EXTRACTED VIDEO DATA?

I can see the Gemini analysis in the admin panel when I click on processed videos. 
But I need to confirm Professor OS is actually USING this data when responding to users.

PLEASE TRACE THE DATA FLOW:

1. WHAT DATA IS GEMINI EXTRACTING?
   Show me an example of what gets stored for one processed video:
   - Techniques extracted?
   - Timestamps?
   - Key concepts?
   - Position categories?
   - What fields in ai_video_knowledge get populated?

2. HOW DOES THIS DATA GET TO PROFESSOR OS?
   When a user asks a question:
   - How are relevant videos selected?
   - Is it searching the Gemini-extracted fields (techniques, concepts)?
   - Or just matching on video titles?
   - Show me the actual query/code that retrieves videos for Prof OS

3. WHAT GETS INJECTED INTO THE PROMPT?
   When Professor OS responds, what video context does it receive?
   - Just video titles and URLs?
   - Or the full extracted knowledge (techniques, timestamps, concepts)?
   - Show me an example of what video data gets injected into the system prompt

4. TEST IT LIVE
   Run this test query through the system and show me:
   
   User query: "How do I pass knee shield?"
   
   Show me:
   a) What videos the semantic search returns
   b) What extracted data from those videos gets sent to Claude
   c) The actual video recommendations in the response
   
   I want to see the FULL chain: User question → Video search → Data injection → AI response

5. THE REAL QUESTION:
   If a video has this Gemini-extracted data:
   - "Technique: Knee shield smash pass"
   - "Timestamp 4:32: Key detail about hip pressure"
   - "Concept: Collapsing the frame"
   
   Does Professor OS receive ALL of this when responding?
   Or does it only get the video title?

I need to see proof that the Gemini analysis is being USED, not just stored.

This will confirm whether the pipeline is complete:

```
Gemini extracts data → Stored in DB → Retrieved on query → Injected into prompt → Used by Claude
        ✅                  ✅              ???                  ???                  ???
```

**We know steps 1-2 work. We need to verify steps 3-5.**
