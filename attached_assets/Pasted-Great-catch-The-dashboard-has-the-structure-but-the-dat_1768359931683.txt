Great catch. The dashboard has the structure but the data isn’t flowing properly. Let’s fix it:

```
META INSIGHTS DASHBOARD - DATA NOT DISPLAYING PROPERLY

The Meta Insights Dashboard structure is built, but the data isn't showing correctly. Here's what's broken:

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ISSUES TO FIX
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. TECHNIQUES TRACKED (shows 35)
   - Problem: Can't click to see what the 35 techniques are
   - Fix: Make this clickable → opens modal/expandable list showing all 35 techniques

2. USER REQUESTS 7d (shows 4)
   - Problem: Can't click to see what the 4 requests were
   - Fix: Make this clickable → opens modal/expandable list showing the 4 requests with details

3. NEED CURATION (shows 32)
   - Problem: Can't click to see what needs curation
   - Fix: Make this clickable → opens modal/expandable list showing all 32 techniques needing curation

4. TRENDING TECHNIQUES TAB
   - Problem: Shows "No trending techniques yet"
   - Question: What triggers a technique to be "trending"? Is this logic implemented?
   - Fix: Either populate with data or clarify what conditions create trending status

5. USER REQUESTS TAB
   - Problem: Shows "No requests yet" but the stat card shows 4 requests
   - Fix: This is a bug - the tab should show the same 4 requests the stat card references

6. UNMET REQUESTS TAB
   - Problem: Shows "No unmet requests - all user questions have video coverage!"
   - Question: Is this accurate? Or is hadVideoResult not being tracked properly?
   - Fix: Verify the tracking is working. If users asked questions and got no videos, this should show them.

ENHANCEMENTS REQUESTED
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. MAKE ALL STAT CARDS CLICKABLE
   - Clicking any stat card should expand to show the underlying data
   - Use a modal or expandable section below the cards

2. RUN ANALYSIS BUTTON
   - Currently says "running in background" - add visual confirmation when complete
   - Show toast notification: "Analysis complete - X techniques updated"

3. DATA CONSISTENCY
   - Stat cards and tabs should show the same data
   - If "User Requests (7d)" shows 4, the "User Requests" tab should show those 4

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
QUESTIONS TO ANSWER
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. Where is the "35 techniques tracked" data coming from? Show me the query.
2. Where is the "4 user requests" data coming from? Why doesn't it show in the tab?
3. What makes a technique "trending"? Is this logic implemented?
4. Is hadVideoResult being tracked correctly when Professor OS responds?

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PRIORITY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. Fix User Requests tab to show the 4 requests (data exists but not displaying)
2. Make stat cards clickable to show details
3. Verify hadVideoResult tracking is working
4. Clarify/implement trending logic

Show me what's causing the data mismatch between stat cards and tabs.
