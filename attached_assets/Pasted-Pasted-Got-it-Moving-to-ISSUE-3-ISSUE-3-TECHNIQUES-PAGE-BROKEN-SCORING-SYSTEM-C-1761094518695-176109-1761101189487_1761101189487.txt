Got it! Moving to **ISSUE #3**.

# **ISSUE #3: TECHNIQUES PAGE - BROKEN SCORING SYSTEM**

**Current Problems:**

1. **Overall Score shows “7.5/100”** - should be out of 10, not 100
1. **Key Detail shows “0/40”** - no scores populated
1. **Credibility shows “unknown/30”** - not useful, should show actual instructor tier (Elite, Established, etc.)
1. **Production shows “0/10”** - empty
1. **Teaching shows “0/20”** - empty
1. **All columns are confusing and provide no actionable value**
1. **Status shows “Accepted”** but scores don’t make sense

-----
