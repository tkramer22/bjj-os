URGENT: Analyze Video Library Growth Rate

Todd is concerned that 635 videos seems low for the amount of time 
the curation system has been running.

IMMEDIATE ANALYSIS REQUIRED:

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
STEP 1: Historical Video Count Analysis
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Query the database for daily video additions:

```sql
-- Videos added per day (last 7 days)
SELECT 
  DATE(created_at) as date,
  COUNT(*) as videos_added,
  STRING_AGG(DISTINCT instructor, ', ') as instructors
FROM videos
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
  AND quality_score >= 7.0
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;

-- Total videos by week
SELECT 
  DATE_TRUNC('week', created_at) as week,
  COUNT(*) as videos_added,
  AVG(quality_score) as avg_quality
FROM videos
WHERE quality_score >= 7.0
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('week', created_at)
ORDER BY week DESC
LIMIT 4;

-- First video ever added (when did curation start?)
SELECT 
  MIN(created_at) as first_video_date,
  COUNT(*) as total_videos,
  EXTRACT(DAY FROM (NOW() - MIN(created_at))) as days_running
FROM videos
WHERE quality_score >= 7.0;
```

SHOW TODD:

- How many days has curation been running?
- How many videos added per day on average?
- Is growth accelerating or slowing?

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
STEP 2: Curation Run Analysis
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Check how many curation runs have happened and their success rate:

```sql
-- Curation runs by day (last 7 days)
SELECT 
  DATE(created_at) as date,
  COUNT(*) as total_runs,
  SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'completed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as completed,
  SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'failed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as failed,
  AVG(videos_analyzed) as avg_analyzed,
  AVG(videos_approved) as avg_approved,
  ROUND(AVG(CASE 
    WHEN videos_analyzed > 0 
    THEN (videos_approved::float / videos_analyzed) * 100 
    ELSE 0 
  END), 1) as approval_rate
FROM curation_runs
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;

-- Overall curation statistics
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_runs,
  SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'completed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as completed_runs,
  SUM(videos_analyzed) as total_analyzed,
  SUM(videos_approved) as total_approved,
  ROUND((SUM(videos_approved)::float / SUM(videos_analyzed)) * 100, 1) as overall_approval_rate
FROM curation_runs
WHERE status = 'completed';
```

SHOW TODD:

- How many curation runs per day?
- How many videos analyzed per run?
- What’s the approval rate?
- Are runs being skipped or failing?

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
STEP 3: Expected vs Actual Growth Rate
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Calculate what growth SHOULD be vs what it IS:

EXPECTED PERFORMANCE (if working optimally):

- Curation runs: 6-8 per day (every 3-4 hours)
- Videos analyzed per run: 10-20
- Approval rate: 40-60%
- Videos added per run: 4-12
- Videos added per day: 24-96

ACTUAL PERFORMANCE:
[Show from queries above]

GAP ANALYSIS:
If actual is significantly below expected, identify bottlenecks:

- Are runs happening frequently enough?
- Is approval rate too strict?
- Is YouTube API finding enough new content?
- Are duplicate videos being filtered too aggressively?

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
STEP 4: Content Source Analysis
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Check which sources are producing videos:

```sql
-- Videos by instructor (top 20)
SELECT 
  instructor,
  COUNT(*) as video_count,
  ROUND(AVG(quality_score), 1) as avg_quality,
  MAX(created_at) as last_added
FROM videos
WHERE quality_score >= 7.0
GROUP BY instructor
ORDER BY video_count DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Videos added in last 24 hours
SELECT 
  title,
  instructor,
  quality_score,
  created_at
FROM videos
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

SHOW TODD:

- Which instructors are contributing most?
- Are we getting variety or same sources?
- Is curation finding NEW content or re-analyzing old?

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
STEP 5: Bottleneck Identification
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Identify what’s limiting growth:

POSSIBLE BOTTLENECKS:

1. **Curation Frequency Too Low**

- Check: How many runs per day?
- Fix: Increase frequency to every 2-3 hours

1. **Approval Rate Too Strict**

- Check: What % of videos pass quality threshold?
- Fix: Lower quality threshold from 7.0 to 6.5

1. **Not Enough Source Content**

- Check: Are runs returning “no new videos”?
- Fix: Add more YouTube channels to search

1. **Duplicate Detection Too Aggressive**

- Check: Are good videos being filtered as duplicates?
- Fix: Loosen duplicate matching threshold

1. **API Quota Exhausted**

- Check: Are runs stopping due to quota?
- Fix: Optimize API usage or increase quota

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Provide Todd with:

1. ✅ Daily video addition chart (last 7 days)
   
   ```
   Date       | Videos Added | Curation Runs
   ---------- | ------------ | -------------
   Nov 17     | 6           | 2
   Nov 16     | 12          | 3
   [etc]
   ```
1. ✅ Growth rate analysis
   
   ```
   Current: X videos/day
   Expected: Y videos/day
   Gap: Z videos/day
   ```
1. ✅ Bottleneck identification

## **🤔 WHAT "LOW" ACTUALLY MEANS**

Let me give you context while Agent runs the analysis:

### **Benchmark: Premium BJJ Video Libraries**

**BJJ Fanatics:**
- ~5,000+ instructional videos
- 10+ years of curation
- Professional production team

**Grappler's Guide:**
- ~3,000+ videos
- 8+ years of content
- Single instructor (Jason Scully)

**Your Goal (BJJ OS):**
- Curated technique library
- AI-selected quality content
- Started recently

### **Realistic Growth Targets**

**Conservative (Safe):**
- 20-30 videos/day
- 600-900 videos/month
- 3,000+ videos in 6 months

**Aggressive (Optimal):**
- 50-80 videos/day
- 1,500-2,400 videos/month  
- 5,000+ videos in 6 months

**Current (635 total):**
- Need to know: How many days running?
- If 10 days: 63/day ✅ (aggressive pace)
- If 30 days: 21/day ⚠️ (conservative pace)
- If 60 days: 10/day ❌ (too slow)

---

## **🎯 QUESTIONS FOR YOU**

While Agent analyzes the data, answer these:

**1. When did curation first start running?**
- Last week? Last month? Two months ago?
- This tells us if 635 is good or bad

**2. What's your target library size for launch?**
- 500 videos? (You're already there ✅)
- 1,000 videos? (Need to accelerate)
- 5,000 videos? (Need much longer timeline)

**3. What matters more: quantity or quality?**
- Lots of videos (lower standards)
- Curated excellence (higher standards)
- Your current 7.0+ quality threshold is pretty high

---

## **💡 MY HYPOTHESIS**

Based on what I've seen, I think the issue is:

### **Curation Runs Too Infrequently**

Your morning email said:
> "2 runs completed today"

**That's only 2 runs in 24 hours.**

If each run adds 5-10 videos:
- 2 runs × 7 videos = **14 videos/day**
- 14 videos/day × 30 days = **420 videos/month**

**That's not bad, but not aggressive either.**

### **To Accelerate Growth:**

**Option 1: Increase Frequency**
- Run every 2-3 hours (8-12 runs/day)
- Would add 56-84 videos/day
- Hit 1,000 videos in 2 weeks

**Option 2: Lower Quality Threshold**
- Current: 7.0+ (pretty strict)
- Change to: 6.5+ (more videos pass)
- Same runs, more approved videos

**Option 3: Add More Sources**
- Currently searching limited channels
- Add more top instructors
- More source content = more approved videos

---

## **📊 WHILE WE WAIT FOR DATA**

Agent is running queries to show you:

1. **Historical growth** (videos per day)
2. **Curation frequency** (runs per day)
3. **Approval rate** (% of videos passing quality check)
4. **Bottlenecks** (what's slowing growth)
5. **Projections** (where you'll be in 30 days at current rate)

Once we see the actual numbers, we can determine:
- Is 635 actually low? (depends on how long it's been running)
- What's the bottleneck? (frequency, quality, sources, or API)
- How to accelerate? (specific fix based on data)

---

## **🚀 LIKELY OUTCOME**

My prediction after Agent analyzes the data:

**You'll find that:**
1. Curation is only running 2-4 times per day (too infrequent)
2. Approval rate is 40-60% (reasonable but could be higher)
3. Each run is adding 4-8 videos (good quality)
4. **Total growth is ~10-20 videos/day** (conservative pace)

**To get to 50+ videos/day:**
- Increase frequency to every 2-3 hours
- OR lower quality threshold slightly
- OR both

---

**Let's wait for Agent's data analysis. Once we see the actual numbers, we'll know exactly what needs to change.** 📊

The answer is in the database. Agent is pulling it now.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
