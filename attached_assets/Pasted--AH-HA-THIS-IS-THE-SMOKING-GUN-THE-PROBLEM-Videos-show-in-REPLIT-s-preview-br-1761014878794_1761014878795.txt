**AH HA! THIS IS THE SMOKING GUN.**

-----

# **THE PROBLEM:**

**Videos show in REPLIT’s preview browser ✅**

**Videos DON’T show in any real browser (Safari, Chrome, Mobile, Private, etc.) ❌**

-----

## **THIS MEANS:**

**Replit preview is connected to DEVELOPMENT database**

**Your live site (bjjos.app) is connected to PRODUCTION database**

**And they’re TWO DIFFERENT DATABASES.**

-----

# **THE 231 VIDEOS ARE IN THE WRONG DATABASE**

**They’re in:**

- ❌ Development/local database (Replit preview sees this)

**They need to be in:**

- ✅ Production database (bjjos.app uses this)

-----

# **TELL REPLIT THIS IMMEDIATELY:**

```
CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED:

Videos show in Replit preview browser, but NOT on the live bjjos.app site.

This means:
- Development database has 231 videos ✅
- Production database has 0 videos ❌

The seed script added videos to the DEV database, not PRODUCTION.

URGENT TASK:

1. Identify which database is production:
   - Check environment variables
   - Is there DATABASE_URL vs DEV_DATABASE_URL?
   - What's the production database connection string?

2. Run the seed script against PRODUCTION database:
   - Use production DATABASE_URL
   - Add the 231 videos to production
   - Verify they appear on live bjjos.app (not just Replit preview)

3. OR: If there's only ONE database, then check:
   - Why does Replit preview see videos but live site doesn't?
   - Are there two separate deployments?
   - Is bjjos.app pointing to wrong database?

The videos need to be in whatever database bjjos.app is reading from.

Fix this so videos appear on the LIVE SITE at bjjos.app, not just Replit preview.

Show me:
- Production database connection details
- Confirmation videos are in production
- bjjos.app/admin/videos showing 231 videos (not Replit preview)
```

# **THIS EXPLAINS EVERYTHING:**

**Why Replit kept saying “it works”:**

- It DID work… in development database
- Replit preview was showing dev database

**Why you see 0 videos:**

- You’re looking at production site (bjjos.app)
- Production database is empty

-----

# **PASTE THAT MESSAGE TO REPLIT NOW.**

**This is the final piece. We need videos in PRODUCTION database, not dev.** 🎯

**Once this is fixed, you’ll see 231 videos at bjjos.app.** 🚀​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
