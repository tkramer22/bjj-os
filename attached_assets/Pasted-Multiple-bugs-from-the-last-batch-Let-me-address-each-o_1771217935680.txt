Multiple bugs from the last batch. Let me address each one:

URGENT FIXES — LAST UPDATE BROKE THINGS

⚠️ These are regressions from the last deployment. Fix immediately.

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
BUG 1: DELETE AND UPDATE SESSION BROKEN
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Delete Session and Update Session stopped working after the last 
update. They were working fine before.

LIKELY CAUSE: The haptics additions are throwing JavaScript errors 
that break the delete/update handlers. If Haptics.impact() or 
Haptics.notification() throws an undefined error, it stops the 
function from completing the actual delete/update API call.

FIX:
1. Find every haptic call in the Training tab code
2. Wrap EVERY SINGLE ONE in a try/catch:

   try {
     await Haptics.impact({ style: ImpactStyle.Light });
   } catch (e) {
     // silently ignore — haptics not available
   }

   OR better — create a safe wrapper function:

   const safeHaptic = async (style) => {
     try {
       await Haptics.impact({ style });
     } catch (e) {}
   };

   const safeNotification = async (type) => {
     try {
       await Haptics.notification({ type });
     } catch (e) {}
   };

   Use safeHaptic() and safeNotification() everywhere instead of 
   calling Haptics directly.

3. Make sure the haptic call does NOT block the delete/update logic.
   The delete should work even if haptics fail. The haptic is cosmetic.
   The API call is critical. Never let a haptic error prevent a 
   database operation.

4. Check the delete handler specifically:
   - Does it call the DELETE /api/training/sessions/:id endpoint?
   - Does it await the response?
   - Does it close the bottom sheet after successful delete?
   - Does it refresh the calendar and recent sessions?
   - Is there an error being swallowed silently?

5. Check the update handler:
   - Same checks as delete
   - Does it call PUT /api/training/sessions/:id?
   - Does it close the bottom sheet after successful update?

TEST:
□ Open an existing session
□ Tap Delete → session is deleted, bottom sheet closes, calendar updates
□ Open another session → change mood → tap Update → session updates
□ No JavaScript errors in console
□ Haptics still work where available (but never break functionality)

BUG 2: TIME PICKER NOT SAVING / NOT DEFAULTING
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The time picker is not saving the selected time. When the user sets 
a time on one session, the next session still shows current time 
instead of defaulting to the last saved time.

TWO ISSUES:

A) TIME NOT SAVING TO DATABASE:
   Check that the POST /api/training/sessions endpoint is receiving 
   the session_time value from the frontend. Console.log the request 
   body on the server to verify.
   
   Check that the session_time column exists in training_sessions:
   SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns 
   WHERE table_name = 'training_sessions' AND column_name = 'session_time';
   
   If the column doesn't exist, add it:
   ALTER TABLE training_sessions ADD COLUMN session_time TIME;
   
   Make sure the INSERT and UPDATE queries include session_time.

B) DEFAULT NOT PULLING FROM LAST SESSION:
   The time picker should default to the time from the user's most 
   recent saved session. Query:
   
   SELECT session_time FROM training_sessions 
   WHERE user_id = $1 AND session_time IS NOT NULL 
   ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
   
   If a time is returned, use it as the default.
   If no time found (first session or no times saved), use current time.
   
   This query should run when the bottom sheet OPENS, not on page load.

TEST:
□ Log a session at 6:30 PM
□ Open bottom sheet for a new session → time defaults to 6:30 PM
□ Change time to 8:00 AM → save
□ Open bottom sheet again → time defaults to 8:00 AM
□ Check Recent Sessions → time shows on the session card

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
BUG 3: TIME PICKER SCROLL MUST LOOP INFINITELY
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The time picker scroll wheels currently stop at the min/max values.
They should loop infinitely like a native iOS picker:

HOURS: ... 11 → 12 → 1 → 2 → 3 ... (loops forever in both directions)
MINUTES: ... 58 → 59 → 00 → 01 → 02 ... (loops forever)
AM/PM: AM → PM → AM → PM (loops forever)

The scroll should never hit a wall or stop. It wraps around 
continuously in both directions.

If using a library for the picker, check if it has a "loop" or 
"infinite" or "circular" prop and enable it.

If custom built, implement modular wrapping:
- Hours: value = ((value - 1) % 12) + 1
- Minutes: value = value % 60
- When scrolling past 12 → show 1
- When scrolling past 59 → show 00
- When scrolling before 1 → show 12
- When scrolling before 00 → show 59

TEST:
□ Scroll hours past 12 → goes to 1 smoothly
□ Scroll hours before 1 → goes to 12 smoothly
□ Scroll minutes past 59 → goes to 00 smoothly
□ Scroll minutes before 00 → goes to 59 smoothly
□ AM/PM loops continuously
□ No stopping, no dead ends, no jerky behavior

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PRIORITY ORDER
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. Fix delete/update FIRST (this is a regression, critical)
2. Fix time saving and defaults
3. Fix infinite scroll on time picker

DO NOT publish until delete and update are confirmed working again.
