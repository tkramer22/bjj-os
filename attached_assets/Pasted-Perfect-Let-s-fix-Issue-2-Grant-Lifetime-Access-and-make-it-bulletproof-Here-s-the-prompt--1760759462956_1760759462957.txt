FIX GRANT LIFETIME ACCESS FEATURE - CRITICAL PRIORITY

Currently there's a database error when trying to grant lifetime access: "relation 'bj_users' does not exist"

REQUIREMENTS:

1. FIX THE DATABASE QUERY ERROR:
   - Find anywhere the code references 'bj_users' (typo)
   - Change to the correct table name (likely 'users')
   - Test the query works

2. GRANT LIFETIME ACCESS FUNCTIONALITY:
   - Input: Phone number (in format +15177770852)
   - Input: Reason (dropdown or text field)
   - Input: Additional notes (optional)
   - Button: "Grant Lifetime Access"

3. WHAT IT SHOULD DO:
   - Look up user by phone number
   - If user doesn't exist, CREATE the user with:
     * phone_number
     * subscription_tier: 'lifetime'
     * subscription_status: 'active'
     * granted_by: admin_id
     * granted_at: current timestamp
     * granted_reason: reason provided
     * notes: additional notes
   - If user DOES exist, UPDATE them to:
     * subscription_tier: 'lifetime'
     * subscription_status: 'active'
     * updated_at: current timestamp
   - NO SMS VERIFICATION REQUIRED - admin bypass
   - Log the action in admin_actions table for audit trail

4. SUCCESS BEHAVIOR:
   - Show success toast: "Lifetime access granted to +1517777XXXX"
   - Clear the form
   - User can immediately use the app (no confirmation needed)
   - Close the modal

5. ERROR HANDLING:
   - Invalid phone format: "Please enter valid phone number (+1XXXXXXXXXX)"
   - Database error: Show actual error message
   - Missing required fields: Highlight fields in red

6. MAKE IT ADMIN-ACCESSIBLE FROM MULTIPLE PLACES:
   - Button on User Management page
   - Button on Overview Dashboard
   - Quick action in top nav bar
   - Keep existing modal location

7. ADD BULK GRANT OPTION:
   - Allow comma-separated phone numbers
   - Grant lifetime access to multiple users at once
   - Show progress indicator
   - Show results: "5 users granted, 2 failed"

8. DISPLAY GRANTED USERS:
   - On User Management page, add filter: "Lifetime Access"
   - Show who granted it and when
   - Show reason for granting

TEST IT:
- Grant access to a new phone number that doesn't exist yet
- Grant access to an existing user
- Try invalid phone formats
- Try leaving reason blank
- Verify user can immediately access app without SMS verification

Make this feature rock-solid - it's critical for onboarding early users quickly.
