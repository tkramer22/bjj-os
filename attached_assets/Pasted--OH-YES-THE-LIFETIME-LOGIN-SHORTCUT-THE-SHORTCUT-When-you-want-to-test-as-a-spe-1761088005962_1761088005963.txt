**OH YES. THE LIFETIME LOGIN SHORTCUT.**

-----

# **THE SHORTCUT:**

When you want to test as a specific user without SMS verification:

1. Go to login screen
1. Enter the user’s phone number
1. When it asks for verification code, just enter: **LIFETIME**
1. System recognizes “LIFETIME” as magic bypass code
1. Logs you in as that user immediately
1. No SMS sent, no waiting

-----

# **PROMPT FOR REPLIT:**

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ADD TESTING SHORTCUT - LIFETIME LOGIN BYPASS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

For testing purposes, add a magic verification code that bypasses SMS.

FEATURE: Lifetime Login Bypass
────────────────────────────────────────────

When user enters verification code, check if code === "LIFETIME"

If true:
- Skip SMS verification entirely
- Log user in immediately
- Set session as if they verified successfully
- Continue to normal app flow

IMPLEMENTATION:
────────────────────────────────────────────

In your SMS verification handler:

if (enteredCode === "LIFETIME") {
  // Bypass verification
  // Mark phone as verified
  // Create/retrieve user session
  // Redirect to app (onboarding or /chat depending on status)
  
  console.log("LIFETIME bypass used for testing: " + phoneNumber);
  
  // Continue as if SMS verification succeeded
}

SECURITY NOTE:
This is for TESTING only. Consider adding:

// Only allow in development
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production" && enteredCode === "LIFETIME") {
  return { error: "Invalid code" };
}

Or keep it enabled if you want to use in production for your own testing.

USE CASE:
────────────────────────────────────────────

Testing flow:
1. Enter phone: +1 (914) 555-1234
2. System shows: "Enter verification code"
3. Enter: LIFETIME
4. Instantly logged in as that user
5. Can test their complete profile/experience

Perfect for:
- Testing different user profiles quickly
- Switching between test users
- Demonstrating to beta testers
- Avoiding SMS costs during testing
- Fast iteration during development

BUILD THIS NOW.
