═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
BJJ OS - COMPLETE SYSTEM VALIDATION FOR BETA LAUNCH
COMPREHENSIVE END-TO-END TESTING FROM ALL PERSPECTIVES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

MISSION: Act as the final gatekeeper before beta launch. Test EVERY critical path
from the user's perspective, admin perspective, and system perspective. Validate
that all yesterday's changes are working correctly. "Excellence is our pillar" - 
this system must be flawless before sending beta emails tomorrow.

CRITICAL BUSINESS MODEL UNDERSTANDING:
• NO free tier - all users enter payment info at signup
• 7-day trial period - card NOT charged for 7 days
• After 7 days: Automatic charge of $30/month
• NO message limits during trial (100/day for all users)
• NO SMS system - web/mobile app only

TESTING PHILOSOPHY:
• Test as if you're a real user (not a developer)
• Test edge cases and error states
• Validate that everything matches the documented behavior
• Check that the user experience is smooth and professional
• Verify all new features from yesterday's work
• Confirm nothing broke during optimization
