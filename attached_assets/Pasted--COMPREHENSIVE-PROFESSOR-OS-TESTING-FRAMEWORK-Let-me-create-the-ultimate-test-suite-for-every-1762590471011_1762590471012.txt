PROFESSOR OS COMPREHENSIVE TESTING SUITE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Testing expert AI systems requires validating:
1. Technical functionality (APIs, database, performance)
2. AI intelligence (context, learning, reasoning)
3. Personality adherence (tone, humor, authenticity)
4. User experience (speed, helpfulness, engagement)

This test suite covers EVERYTHING.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 1: PRE-DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION
