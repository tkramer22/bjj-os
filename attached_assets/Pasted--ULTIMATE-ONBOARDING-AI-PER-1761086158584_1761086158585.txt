ULTIMATE ONBOARDING & AI PERSONALIZATION SYSTEM
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Build a comprehensive user profiling and AI personalization system that creates perfect recommendations for every user.

This system combines explicit onboarding data, behavioral learning, statistical modeling, and predictive AI to deliver the most personalized BJJ learning experience possible.

CRITICAL: NO EMOJIS anywhere in the system. Clean, professional presentation only.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PART 1: ONBOARDING QUESTIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Create a 4-question onboarding flow (+ 1 optional) that captures maximum predictive information:

QUESTION 1: "How old are you?"
────────────────────────────────────────────

Options:
○ 16-20 years old
○ 21-30 years old
○ 31-40 years old
○ 41-50 years old
○ 51-60 years old
○ 61+ years old
○ Prefer not to say

Save as: age (text/range)

WHY THIS MATTERS:
- Injury risk assessment (40+ = higher risk)
- Recovery capacity (youth vs masters)
- Learning approach (physical vs technical)
- Instructor matching (age-appropriate role models)
- Technique filtering (avoid dangerous moves for older users)
- Motivation psychology (different appeals by age)

AI USAGE:
- Calculate injuryRiskScore = f(age, trainingFrequency)
- Filter out high-risk techniques for older users
- Match to age-appropriate instructors
- Adjust tone and messaging by age group
- Emphasize safety and recovery for 40+

QUESTION 2: "How many days per week do you typically train?"
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Options:
○ 1-2 days (Casual)
○ 3-4 days (Regular)
○ 5-6 days (Serious)
○ 7+ days (Athlete)

Save as: trainingFrequency (integer)

WHY THIS MATTERS:
- HIGHEST PREDICTIVE POWER for content needs
- Skill progression rate
- Content depth appetite
- Injury tolerance
- Problem complexity level
- Single best segmentation variable

AI USAGE:
- Primary segmentation variable
- Determines content complexity
- Calculates learning velocity
- Combined with age for injury risk
- Predicts progression rate

QUESTION 3: "What are you struggling with? (Select all that apply)"
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**MULTI-SELECT CHECKBOXES**

Options:
□ Surviving / Not getting dominated
□ Passing guard / Advancing position
□ Guard retention / Staying on top
□ Finishing submissions
□ Dealing with bigger/stronger opponents
□ Using my size/pressure effectively
□ Cardio / Conditioning
□ Everything (I'm new)
□ None of these (I'm doing great)

Save as: struggles (array of strings)

WHY THIS MATTERS:
- Immediate problem identification
- Priority ordering for recommendations
- Pattern recognition (struggle combinations)
- Progression tracking (watch struggles change over time)
- Urgency detection (high struggle density = overwhelmed)
- Body type inference from "bigger opponents" or "using size"

AI USAGE:
- Calculate struggleDensity = selectedStruggles.length / totalOptions
- Pattern matching (common struggle combinations)
- Infer bodyType:
  * "bigger/stronger opponents" selected → bodyType = "smaller"
  * "using my size" selected → bodyType = "larger"
  * Neither selected → bodyType = "average/unknown"
- Prioritize content addressing primary struggles
- Track removal of struggles over time (progression)

QUESTION 4: "What type of BJJ do you train?"
────────────────────────────────────────────

Options:
○ Gi only
○ No-gi only
○ Both gi and no-gi
○ MMA / with striking

Save as: trainingContext (text)

WHY THIS MATTERS:
- Essential content filter (40% of techniques are context-specific)
- Showing gi content to no-gi practitioners = useless
- Instructor selection
- Technique applicability

AI USAGE:
- Filter content by context (gi/no-gi/MMA)
- Boost relevant techniques
- Penalize irrelevant context by -50%
- Match to context-appropriate instructors

QUESTION 5 (OPTIONAL): "What are you already pretty good at? (Optional - Select if any apply)"
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**MULTI-SELECT CHECKBOXES - OPTIONAL**

Options:
□ Guard retention / Playing guard
□ Passing / Top pressure
□ Escapes / Defense
□ Submissions / Finishing
□ Takedowns / Wrestling
□ Movement / Agility
□ Nothing yet / Still figuring it out

Save as: strengths (array of strings, can be empty)

WHY THIS MATTERS:
- Leverage existing skills for faster learning
- Identify play style (guard player vs top player)
- Bridge from strengths to weaknesses
- Build confidence through recognition
- Teaching strategy (use what they know to teach what they don't)

AI USAGE:
- Identify play style profile
- Connect strengths to weaknesses in teaching
- "You're great at guard - use that knowledge to understand passing"
- Boost instructor/content that bridges their strengths to struggles
- Positive reinforcement in messaging

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PART 2: DERIVED METRICS (Calculate immediately after onboarding)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

After user completes onboarding, calculate these metrics:

STRUGGLE DENSITY SCORE:
─────────────────────────────────────────────

struggleDensity = struggles.length / 9  // 9 total struggle options

Interpretation:
if (struggleDensity >= 0.67) {
  userState = "OVERWHELMED";
  action = "Simplify content, add structure, extra encouragement";
  message = "Focus on one area at a time - let's start with defense";
}

if (struggleDensity >= 0.33 && struggleDensity < 0.67) {
  userState = "DEVELOPING";
  action = "Systematic approach, connect concepts";
  message = "Build systems across these areas";
}

if (struggleDensity > 0 && struggleDensity < 0.33) {
  userState = "FOCUSED";
  action = "Deep dive on specific areas";
  message = "Target these specific weaknesses";
}

if (struggleDensity === 0) {
  userState = "CONFIDENT";
  action = "Challenge with advanced content, refinement";
  message = "Ready for advanced concepts and refinement";
}

INJURY RISK SCORE:
─────────────────────────────────────────────

injuryRiskScore = calculateInjuryRisk(age, trainingFrequency)

Logic:
if (age >= 50 && trainingFrequency >= 4) {
  injuryRisk = "VERY_HIGH";
  actions = [
    "Mandatory safety warnings on all content",
    "Avoid: heel hooks, flying submissions, berimbolo, inverted guards",
    "Emphasize: warm-up, mobility, recovery",
    "Show: leverage-based, fundamental techniques only"
  ];
}

if (age >= 40 && trainingFrequency >= 5) {
  injuryRisk = "HIGH";
  actions = [
    "Include safety tips with techniques",
    "Emphasize proper warm-up and recovery",
    "Prefer technical over athletic approaches",
    "Highlight injury prevention"
  ];
}

if (age >= 35 && trainingFrequency >= 6) {
  injuryRisk = "MODERATE_HIGH";
  actions = [
    "Include recovery content",
    "Emphasize efficiency and technique",
    "Mention common injury points"
  ];
}

if (age < 30 && trainingFrequency <= 4) {
  injuryRisk = "LOW";
  actions = [
    "Can show athletic content",
    "Competition intensity appropriate",
    "High-energy instruction"
  ];
}

EXPERIENCE INFERENCE SCORE:
─────────────────────────────────────────────

experienceScore = inferExperience(trainingFrequency, struggles, age)

Calculate score 0-100:

Beginner indicators (score 0-30):
- struggles.includes("surviving")
- struggles.includes("everything")
- trainingFrequency <= 2
- Score calculation: Base 15, +5 for each beginner indicator

Intermediate indicators (score 31-70):
- struggles.includes("passing") OR struggles.includes("finishing")
- struggles.includes("retention")
- trainingFrequency 3-4
- Score calculation: Base 50, adjust ±15 based on combinations

Advanced indicators (score 71-100):
- struggles.length <= 2
- !struggles.includes("surviving")
- !struggles.includes("everything")
- trainingFrequency >= 5
- Score calculation: Base 80, +5 for each advanced indicator

Usage:
- Determines content complexity
- Filters out too-basic or too-advanced content
- Adjusts teaching pace

LEARNING VELOCITY:
─────────────────────────────────────────────

learningVelocity = calculateVelocity(trainingFrequency, experienceScore)

if (trainingFrequency >= 5 && experienceScore < 50) {
  velocity = "FAST";
  // High frequency but beginner struggles = rapid improvement expected
  // Show progressive content, anticipate quick advancement
}

if (trainingFrequency >= 5 && experienceScore >= 70) {
  velocity = "FAST_ADVANCED";
  // High frequency, already advanced = refinement phase
  // Show elite content, competition strategy
}

if (trainingFrequency <= 2 && experienceScore >= 50) {
  velocity = "SLOW_EXPERIENCED";
  // Low frequency but experienced = hobbyist
  // Show sustainable content, don't overwhelm
}

if (trainingFrequency <= 2 && experienceScore < 30) {
  velocity = "SLOW_BEGINNER";
  // Low frequency, beginner = casual learner
  // Extra patient instruction, celebrate small wins
}

Usage:
- Predicts progression timeline
- Adjusts content release pace
- Sets expectations for advancement

BODY TYPE INFERENCE:
─────────────────────────────────────────────

if (struggles.includes("bigger/stronger opponents")) {
  bodyType = "SMALLER";
  contentAdjustments = {
    prioritize: [
      "technical_passing",
      "guard_play",
      "leverage_based_techniques",
      "movement_and_timing"
    ],
    avoid: [
      "pure_pressure_passing",
      "size_dependent_techniques"
    ],
    instructors: [
      "Mikey Musumeci",
      "Miyao brothers",
      "Cobrinha",
      "Bruno Malfacine"
    ],
    messaging: "Technique beats size - here's how smaller grapplers dominate"
  };
}

if (struggles.includes("using my size")) {
  bodyType = "LARGER";
  contentAdjustments = {
    prioritize: [
      "pressure_passing",
      "top_control",
      "smash_systems",
      "weight_distribution"
    ],
    avoid: [
      "berimbolo",
      "inverted_guards",
      "complex_spinning_guards"
    ],
    instructors: [
      "Bernardo Faria",
      "Gordon Ryan",
      "Buchecha",
      "Xande Ribeiro"
    ],
    messaging: "Leverage your size advantage effectively"
  };
}

if (!struggles.includes("bigger opponents") && !struggles.includes("using size")) {
  bodyType = "AVERAGE_OR_UNKNOWN";
  contentAdjustments = {
    default: "show_universal_techniques",
    learnFromBehavior: true,
    adaptDynamically: true
  };
}

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

- Confidence score for assignment

clusterAssignment = {
  cluster: "TECHNICAL_STUDENT",
  confidence: 0.87,
  secondBest: "OVERWHELMED_IMPROVER",
  reasoning: "3-4 days/week, passing+retention struggles, systematic preferences"
};

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PART 4: HOW EACH AI AGENT USES THE PROFILE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

INTERPRETER AGENT:
Uses the complete profile to understand user intent

When user asks a question, Interpreter receives:
{
  age: 38,
  trainingFrequency: 4,
  struggles: ["passing", "finishing"],
  strengths: ["guard_retention"],
  context: "both",
  bodyType: "average",
  
  // Derived:
  injuryRisk: "MODERATE_HIGH",
  experienceScore: 58,
  struggleDensity: 0.33,
  learningVelocity: "MEDIUM",
  userState: "FOCUSED",
  cluster: "TECHNICAL_STUDENT"
}

Interpreter adjusts:
- Complexity level (based on experienceScore)
- Safety emphasis (based on injuryRisk)
- Urgency detection (based on struggles)
- Tone (based on cluster and age)
- Teaching approach (based on learningVelocity)

Example:
Query: "How to pass half guard?"

Interpreter output:
{
  skillLevel: "intermediate",
  urgency: "HIGH", // passing is primary struggle
  safetyNeeded: "MODERATE", // age 38
  preferredStyle: "systematic_conceptual", // Technical Student cluster
  emotionalState: "focused_problem_solving",
  context: "both_gi_nogi"
}

MATCHER AGENT:
Uses profile for multi-objective ranking

Ranking formula:
finalScore = (
  0.25 * queryRelevance +
  0.20 * struggleMatch +           // Does this address their struggle?
  0.15 * safetyAppropriateness +   // Based on age and injury risk
  0.15 * contextMatch +            // Gi/no-gi/MMA match
  0.10 * clusterSuccessRate +      // What worked for similar users
  0.10 * instructorPreference +    // Learned from behavior
  0.05 * bodyTypeMatch            // If applicable
)

Adjustments:
- Age 40+ → boost safetyRating by 15%, penalize injuryRisk by -20%
- Primary struggle → boost content addressing it by 25%
- Wrong context (gi video for no-gi user) → penalize by -50%
- Cluster "Technical Student" → boost systematic/conceptual content by 15%
- bodyType "smaller" → boost technical over pressure techniques by 10%

SYNTHESIZER AGENT:
Uses profile for tone and presentation

Age-based tone:
if (age <= 25) {
  tone = "energetic_and_challenging";
  language = "Competition, domination, athleticism";
}
if (age 26-35) {
  tone = "professional_and_balanced";
  language = "Optimization, development, performance";
}
if (age 36-45) {
  tone = "technical_and_sustainable";
  language = "Efficiency, longevity, smart training";
}
if (age 46+) {
  tone = "encouraging_and_wisdom_focused";
  language = "Mastery, technique, lifelong learning";
}

Struggle-based framing:
if (struggles.includes("passing") && primary) {
  opening = "Passing is your focus area - let's build a complete system.";
}

if (struggles.includes("surviving")) {
  approach = "extra_patient_and_encouraging";
  message = "This is tough right now, but you're going to get through this.";
}

Safety integration:
if (injuryRisk >= "HIGH") {
  includeInEveryResponse = "Safety note: [specific precautions for this technique]";
}

Body type messaging:
if (bodyType === "SMALLER" && technique.requires === "pressure") {
  reframe = "Here's how smaller grapplers use angles instead of pressure...";
}

EVALUATOR AGENT:
Measures success differently by profile

Success criteria by age:
Younger users (<30):
- Weight: immediate engagement (30%), full video watch (30%)
- Expect: Quick clicks, athletic execution

Older users (40+):
- Weight: full video watch (35%), technical understanding (25%)
- Expect: Patient viewing, safety-conscious execution

Success criteria by cluster:
Technical Students:
- Weight: conceptual understanding (30%), full system completion (25%)
- Measure: Do they watch related videos in sequence?

Competitors:
- Weight: immediate application (30%), competition relevance (25%)
- Measure: Do they return before competitions?

Track progression:
- Monitor struggle changes over time
- Celebrate removed struggles
- Predict next struggles based on progression patterns
- Alert if stuck (same struggles 8+ weeks)

WEB SEARCH HANDLER:
Age and context influence external searches

if (age >= 45 && query.includes("conditioning")) {
  searchQuery = "bjj conditioning over 40 masters division";
  sources = ["masters_bjj_blogs", "sports_medicine_40plus"];
}

if (age < 25 && query.includes("competition")) {
  searchQuery = "bjj competition strategy youth division";
  sources = ["competition_analysis", "athlete_training"];
}

if (bodyType === "SMALLER" && query.includes("defense")) {
  searchQuery = "smaller grappler defense strategies";
  emphasize = "technique_over_strength";
}

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PART 5: BEHAVIORAL LEARNING (Don't Ask - Infer)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Track these behaviors to refine profile:

INSTRUCTOR PREFERENCES:
Track which instructors user engages with most:
- Click rates by instructor
- Watch completion by instructor
- Satisfaction ratings by instructor

After 5+ interactions:
preferredInstructors = topEngaged(instructors, threshold=0.75);

Example:
User consistently watches Danaher (92% engagement) and Lachlan (87%)
→ learningStyle = "SYSTEMATIC_CONCEPTUAL"
→ Boost similar instructors (Priit, Jon Thomas)

LEARNING STYLE DETECTION:
Track video interaction patterns:

if (avgWatchDuration > 0.80 && preferredLength > 15min) {
  detectedStyle = "DEEP_DIVER";
  // Shows: Long-form systems, comprehensive instruction
}

if (avgWatchDuration < 0.50 && skipsToKeyMoments === true) {
  detectedStyle = "QUICK_LEARNER";
  // Shows: Short clips, specific moments, quick tips
}

if (rewatchesConceptSections === true) {
  detectedStyle = "CONCEPTUAL";
  // Shows: Principle-based teaching, theory
}

CONTENT COMPLEXITY CALIBRATION:
Track success with different complexity levels:

if (advancedContent.completionRate > beginnerContent.completionRate) {
  // User is more advanced than experienceScore suggests
  experienceScore += 10;
  showMoreAdvanced = true;
}

STRUGGLE EVOLUTION:
Track how struggles change:

week1: ["surviving", "cardio", "everything"]
week8: ["surviving", "cardio"]  // Removed "everything" - progress!
week16: ["retention", "cardio"]  // Removed "surviving", added "retention" - major progress!

Actions:
- Celebrate removed struggles
- Update recommendations for new struggles
- Predict next struggles based on patterns

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PART 6: PREDICTIVE MODELING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PROGRESSION PREDICTION:
Based on cluster and current state, predict next needs:

if (cluster === "SURVIVAL_BEGINNER" && weeksSince === 12) {
  predictedNextStruggle = "guard_retention";
  confidence = 0.78;
  action = "Proactively introduce guard concepts";
}

if (cluster === "TECHNICAL_STUDENT" && struggles.includes("passing") && struggles.includes("retention")) {
  predictedInsight = "connecting_guard_concepts";
  suggestion = "Show how guard retention knowledge helps understand passing";
}

CONTENT GAP DETECTION:
Track unmet needs across user base:

if (struggleCount["half_guard_escapes"] > 40 && relevantContent < 5) {
  alert = "HIGH DEMAND: Half guard bottom escapes underserved";
  action = "Prioritize curating this content";
}

PLATEAU PREDICTION:
Identify users at risk of plateau:

if (sameStruggles.duration > 8weeks && engagementDecreasing) {
  plateauRisk = "HIGH";
  action = "Proactive intervention - suggest new focus area";
  message = "You've been working on passing for 2 months. \
             Ready to try a different angle? \
             Sometimes working on retention helps passing click.";
}

CHURN PREDICTION:
Identify at-risk users:

if (daysSinceLastLogin > 14 && previousEngagement === "HIGH") {
  churnRisk = "HIGH";
  action = "Re-engagement campaign";
  message = "We noticed you haven't been around. \
             Here's something new we think you'll love...";
}
