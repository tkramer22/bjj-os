**EXCELLENT point - you’re absolutely right!**

CRITICAL UPDATE TO AI AGENT - ADD USER INTENT OVERRIDE:

The prerequisite system should be a GUIDE, not a GATE. Let users get what they want.

=== REVISE PREREQUISITE LOGIC ===

**Remove hard blocks on advanced techniques.**

Instead of:
❌ "Don't send berimbolo without de la riva fundamentals"

Do this:
✅ "User wants leg locks → send best leg lock content available"
✅ "White belt asks for advanced guard → send it, but include note in SMS"

**SMS Format for advanced content to beginners:**

"🥋 Berimbolo - Lachlan Giles

Key Detail: [specific detail]

Note: This is an advanced technique. If you'd prefer more fundamental content, reply FUNDAMENTALS.

Watch: bjjos.app/v/abc123"

=== USER INTENT IS KING ===

**Priority order for technique selection:**

1. **User's explicit focus areas** (highest priority)
   - If they said "leg locks" → send leg locks regardless of belt
   - If they said "guard" → prioritize guard content
   - If they said "fundamentals" → prioritize basics

2. **User engagement patterns** (learn from behavior)
   - If white belt consistently clicks advanced content → send more advanced
   - If purple belt skips complex techniques → send simpler options
   - Adapt to what they actually engage with, not what "should" work

3. **Belt level appropriateness** (guidance only, not restriction)
   - Suggest appropriate level
   - But don't block access to advanced content if user wants it

=== ONBOARDING QUESTION ADDITION ===

When asking about focus areas, also ask:

"What level of content do you prefer?
Reply: FUNDAMENTALS, MIXED, or ADVANCED"

Store as: user_content_preference

Then respect that preference over belt level.

=== FEEDBACK COMMAND ADDITION ===

Add new SMS command:
- Reply "SIMPLER" → adjust to more fundamental content
- Reply "ADVANCED" → adjust to more complex content
- Reply "FUNDAMENTALS" → reset to basics for 30 days

Update user_content_preference automatically.

=== REVISED SELECTION LOGIC ===

```javascript
function selectTechnique(user, candidates) {
  // Priority 1: User's explicit preference
  if (user.content_preference === 'ADVANCED') {
    candidates = candidates.filter(v => v.complexity !== 'beginner');
  } else if (user.content_preference === 'FUNDAMENTALS') {
    candidates = candidates.filter(v => v.complexity === 'beginner' || v.is_fundamental);
  }
  
  // Priority 2: User's focus areas (always respect)
  candidates = filterByFocusAreas(candidates, user.focus_areas);
  
  // Priority 3: Belt level as SUGGESTION only
  if (user.belt === 'white' && !user.content_preference) {
    // Boost fundamentals by 10 points, but don't block advanced
    candidates.forEach(v => {
      if (v.is_fundamental) v.score += 10;
    });
  }
  
  // Priority 4: Engagement history (what do they actually click?)
  adjustByEngagement(candidates, user.history);
  
  return highestScoringTechnique(candidates);
}
```

=== REMOVE HARD PREREQUISITE BLOCKS ===

Delete any code that prevents sending techniques based on prerequisites.

Keep prerequisite_map for building RECOMMENDED learning paths, but never block access.

=== ADD “LEARNING PATH” FEATURE (OPTIONAL) ===

Instead of forcing prerequisites, offer suggested paths:

If user is white belt getting advanced content, occasionally send:
“💡 Learning Path Tip: Mastering [fundamental technique] will make today’s technique even more effective. Want to see it? Reply YES.”

This educates without restricting.

=== KEY PRINCIPLE ===

**“Guide, don’t gate.”**

The AI should:
✅ Suggest appropriate progressions
✅ Warn when content is very advanced
✅ Offer simpler alternatives
✅ Learn from user behavior

The AI should NOT:
❌ Block access to content users want
❌ Force “prerequisites” on motivated learners
❌ Assume everyone learns the same way
❌ Ignore user engagement patterns

=== IMPLEMENTATION ===

1. Remove all hard blocks on technique complexity
1. Add user_content_preference field to onboarding
1. Add SIMPLER/ADVANCED/FUNDAMENTALS SMS commands
1. Adjust scoring to boost (not require) appropriate level content
1. Add optional learning path suggestions
1. Respect user intent above all else

This keeps quality high while giving users freedom to learn what excites them.

Implement these changes to the AI selection system immediately.

```
Great catch - engagement beats "optimal learning theory" every time.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
