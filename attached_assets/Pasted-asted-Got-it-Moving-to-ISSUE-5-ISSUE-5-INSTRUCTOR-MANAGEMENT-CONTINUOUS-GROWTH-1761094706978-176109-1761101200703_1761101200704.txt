Got it! Moving to **ISSUE #5**.

# **ISSUE #5: INSTRUCTOR MANAGEMENT & CONTINUOUS GROWTH**

**Current Problems:**

1. **How are we continuously adding new instructors?**
1. **How do we ensure we get more videos from ALL instructors (not just top tier)?**
1. **How can I manually boost an instructor’s visibility?** (promote specific instructors to get more views)
1. Need admin control to prioritize instructors strategically
1. System should auto-discover new instructors during video curation
1. Balance between elite instructors and emerging talent

**Current State:**

- 138 total instructors
- 62 Tier 1 (Elite) - 7.0 quality threshold
- 76 Tier 2 (Established) - 7.5 quality threshold
- 1 User Instructor
- Most showing “Videos: 0” (need population)

## **FIX FOR ISSUE #5:**

Build a comprehensive Instructor Management System with auto-discovery, balanced curation, and manual promotion controls:

PART 1 - AUTO-DISCOVERY OF NEW INSTRUCTORS:

1. DURING VIDEO CURATION:
When AI analyzes YouTube videos:
- Extract channel name automatically
- Extract instructor name from video (AI reads who's teaching)
- Check if instructor exists in database
- If NEW instructor found:
  * Auto-create instructor profile
  * Set initial tier: "Unknown" (requires review)
  * Set initial quality threshold: 8.0 (higher bar for unknowns)
  * Flag for admin review: "New instructor found: John Doe - 3 videos analyzed"
  * Auto-populate: channel_id, subscriber_count, video_count

2. INSTRUCTOR PROFILE AUTO-POPULATION:
AI extracts from YouTube channel data:
- Full name
- Channel URL
- Subscriber count (credibility indicator)
- Total videos on channel
- Channel description (look for credentials: "Black belt under...", "IBJJF champion", etc.)
- Social media links (Instagram, website)

AI analyzes first 3-5 videos to determine:
- Specialties (guard passing, leg locks, gi/no-gi)
- Teaching style (detailed, fast-paced, beginner-friendly)
- Competition record (mentions in videos: "This won me gold at...")
- Lineage (who they trained under)

3. WEEKLY NEW INSTRUCTOR REPORT:
Every Sunday, admin receives SMS:
"BJJ OS: 4 new instructors discovered this week:
- John Doe (12 videos found, unknown lineage)
- Mike Smith (8 videos found, black belt under Marcelo Garcia)
- Sarah Lee (6 videos found, IBJJF purple belt world champion)
Review at bjjos.app/admin/instructors/new"

4. AUTO-TIER ASSIGNMENT (INITIAL):
System makes educated guess based on:

**Auto-assign Tier 1 (Elite) if:**
- IBJJF world champion mentioned
- ADCC competitor
- Famous lineage (trained under Roger Gracie, Marcelo Garcia, etc.)
- 100K+ YouTube subscribers
- Cross-referenced with known elite list

**Auto-assign Tier 2 (Established) if:**
- Black belt mentioned
- 10K+ subscribers
- 50+ instructional videos
- Teaches at known gym
- Regional competition wins mentioned

**Auto-assign "Under Review" if:**
- Can't verify credentials
- New channel (<10 videos)
- Low production quality
- No competition record found

Admin can override any auto-assignment.

PART 2 - BALANCED VIDEO CURATION ACROSS ALL INSTRUCTORS:

1. INSTRUCTOR QUOTA SYSTEM:
Set targets to ensure diversity:

**Per Curation Run, Target:**
- 40% from Tier 1 (Elite) instructors
- 40% from Tier 2 (Established) instructors  
- 15% from Under Review instructors (give them a chance)
- 5% from User Submitted content

This prevents library from being 90% John Danaher videos.

2. INSTRUCTOR COVERAGE TRACKING:
Show admin dashboard:

┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  INSTRUCTOR VIDEO DISTRIBUTION                            │

│  2. Lachlan Giles - 34 videos (13% of library)           │
│  3. Gordon Ryan - 28 videos (11% of library)             │

│                                                           │
│  Coverage Analysis:                                       │
│  ⚠️ 23 instructors have only 1-2 videos (under-served)   │
│  ✅ 18 instructors have 10+ videos (well-covered)        │
│  🎯 Recommended: Search for more Victor Hugo, Craig Jones│
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

3. AUTO-BALANCING ALGORITHM:
When running curation:
- Check current distribution
- If John Danaher has 50 videos and Victor Hugo has 2:
  * Lower Danaher's priority temporarily
  * Boost Victor Hugo's priority
  * System searches: "Victor Hugo BJJ" specifically
- Prevents any single instructor from dominating library

4. MINIMUM VIDEO THRESHOLD:
Set rule: Every Tier 1 and Tier 2 instructor should have at least 5 videos
- System tracks who's below threshold
- Auto-triggers targeted searches: "Lachlan Giles leg locks", "Bernardo Faria pressure passing"
- Admin sees: "3 instr...
