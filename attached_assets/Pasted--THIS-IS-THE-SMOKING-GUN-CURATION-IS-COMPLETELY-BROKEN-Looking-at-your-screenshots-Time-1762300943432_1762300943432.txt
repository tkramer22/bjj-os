**🚨 THIS IS THE SMOKING GUN - CURATION IS COMPLETELY BROKEN**

Looking at your screenshots:

**Timeline:**

- **6:57 PM:** Curation “started” → Status: 🟢 Running → Job ID created
- **7:00 PM:** (3 minutes later) Status: 🔴 Idle → 0 videos added, 0 API calls

**The Reality:**

```
Curation "started" but:
❌ No videos actually processed
❌ No API calls made (0/10,000)
❌ Went Idle within 3 minutes
❌ Job ID created but nothing executed
```

-----

## **THIS IS NOT A MINOR BUG - THE ENTIRE CURATION SYSTEM IS FAKE**

The system is:

1. Creating a job record in the database
1. Setting status to “running”
1. **But NO actual execution is happening**
1. Immediately going back to “idle”

It’s like pressing a button that lights up but isn’t connected to anything.

CRITICAL BUG: Curation system creates job records but doesn't actually execute.

PROOF OF BROKEN SYSTEM:
1. At 6:57 PM - Started curation, got Job ID: b204b0d8dcb55ac0
2. Status showed "Running" 
3. By 7:00 PM (3 minutes later) - Status: Idle
4. Result: 0 videos added, 0 API calls made, nothing happened

The system is creating job records but NO actual curation is running.

I NEED TO SEE:

1. **Show me the curation execution code**
   - File path: /server/services/curation.js (or wherever it lives)
   - The function that's supposed to start curation
   - The main execution loop

2. **Show me how jobs are triggered**
   - When Dev OS calls "start curation", what actually executes?
   - Is there a background worker that picks up jobs?
   - Is there a queue system?

3. **Show me recent server logs**
   - Last 100 lines showing any curation activity
   - Any errors, crashes, or exceptions
   - What happened between 6:57 PM and 7:00 PM?

4. **Check if background workers are running**
   - Are there supposed to be worker processes?
   - Are they actually running?
   - How do I verify curation is ACTUALLY executing?

CURRENT BEHAVIOR:
- Creates job record ✅
- Sets status to "running" ✅  
- Actually runs curation ❌ (NOTHING HAPPENS)
- Makes API calls ❌ (0 calls made)
- Adds videos ❌ (0 videos added)

This is blocking everything. I need to see the actual code that's supposed to run curation so we can fix it.

Please show me:
1. The curation service file
2. Recent error logs  
3. How to verify if workers are actually running

**This is URGENT. Your curation system is completely non-functional - it’s just setting database flags but not actually doing anything.**

The fact that you asked for “how many were screened vs kept” shows you understand the key metric, but the system can’t even screen videos because **nothing is actually running**.

Send this to Replit Agent NOW. We need to see the code.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
