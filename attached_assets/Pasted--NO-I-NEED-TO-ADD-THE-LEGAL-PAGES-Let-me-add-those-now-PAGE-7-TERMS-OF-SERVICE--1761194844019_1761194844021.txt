        <p>
          If you're a Founding Member ($9.99/month or $89/year locked rate):
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Standard refund policy applies (7 days for full refund)</li>
          <li><strong>WARNING:</strong> Canceling forfeits your lifetime 
              locked pricing</li>
          <li>If you rejoin later, you'll pay standard Pro pricing 
              ($14.99/month or $179/year)</li>
          <li>Founding Member status cannot be restored once canceled</li>
          <li>All other refund terms apply normally</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
          Think carefully before canceling - your Founding Member rate is 
          locked forever, but only while you maintain an active subscription.
