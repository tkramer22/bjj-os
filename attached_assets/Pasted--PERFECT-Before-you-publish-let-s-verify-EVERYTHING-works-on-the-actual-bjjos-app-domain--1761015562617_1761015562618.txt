CRITICAL: Test everything on https://bjjos.app, NOT on Replit preview.

Only tell me "Ready to Publish" if ALL 8 items above work on the live bjjos.app domain.

For each item, report: ✅ WORKS or ❌ BROKEN (with details)

Do this verification now before I publish.
```

# **WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT:**

**Replit has been telling you “it works” based on preview.**

**We need PROOF it works on:**

- ✅ bjjos.app (live domain)
- ✅ Production database
- ✅ Real browsers (not Replit preview)

-----

# **AFTER REPLIT RESPONDS:**

**If all 8 items are ✅:**

- Click Publish
- Launch tomorrow

**If any items are ❌:**

- Fix those specific issues
- Re-test
- THEN publish

-----

**Don’t publish until you have confirmation all 8 work on bjjos.app.**

**Paste that verification checklist now.** ✅🎯​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
