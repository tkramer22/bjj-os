TWO TASKS — DO BOTH AND REPORT BACK

⚠️ Do not change any code. Only test and document.

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
TASK 1: DOCUMENT THE iOS SIGN-IN FLOW
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Walk me through exactly what happens when a NEW user downloads the BJJ OS
app from the App Store and opens it for the first time.

Answer these questions by reading the iOS-related code:

1. What is the FIRST screen they see when they open the app?
1. Do they see a login screen, a signup screen, or a landing/welcome screen?
1. Are they asked to create an account immediately? If so, what fields?
1. When does payment happen?
- Before they can use anything?
- After a free preview?
- During onboarding?
1. Is there an in-app purchase / Apple subscription, or does it use Stripe?
1. Is there a free trial on iOS? How many days?
1. What is the onboarding flow on iOS? List every screen and question in order.
1. After onboarding, where do they land?
1. Can they use the app at all without paying?

Show me the specific files and code that handle:

- iOS first launch / welcome screen
- iOS signup/login screen
- iOS payment/subscription screen
- iOS onboarding screens (list each question)

TASK 2: TEST FULL WEB SIGNUP FLOW END TO END
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Test the complete web signup flow from start to finish. Use a real test
email that can receive emails (or check server logs for the verification
code if email sending is not yet working).

STEP BY STEP — report what happens at each step:

□ Step 1: Visit bjjos.app

- Does landing page load?
- What does the CTA button say?
- What price is shown?
- What trial length is mentioned?

□ Step 2: Click the CTA button

- What screen appears?
- Is it the email entry screen with the 4-step progress indicator?

□ Step 3: Enter a test email and click Continue

- What happens?
- Does it move to the verification code screen?
- Is a verification code actually sent? Check:
  a) The test email inbox
  b) Server logs for the email send attempt
  c) The email_verification_codes table in the database
- If code was NOT sent, what error appears in server logs?

□ Step 4: Enter the verification code

- Does it validate?
- What screen appears next?

□ Step 5: Stripe checkout

- Does Stripe checkout load?
- What price does it show?
- What trial period does it show? (Should be 3 days)
- Complete payment with test card: 4242 4242 4242 4242, any future expiry, any CVC

□ Step 6: After payment

- What screen appears? (Should be password creation)
- Create a password — does it save?

□ Step 7: Onboarding

- How many onboarding screens appear?
- List each question and the options shown
- Complete all screens

□ Step 8: Dashboard

- Does dashboard load?
- Does Professor OS greet the user by name?
- Is all onboarding data saved? Check database:
  SELECT name, email, belt_level, training_style, training_frequency,
  subscription_status, referral_code_used
  FROM users WHERE email = ‘[test email]’;

□ Step 9: Logout and login

- Log out
- Go to /login
- Enter the test email + password created in Step 6
- Does login work?
- Does dashboard load with all data intact?

REPORT FORMAT:
For each step, tell me:
✅ PASS — what you saw
❌ FAIL — what went wrong, include error messages and server logs

For Task 1, show me the actual code files and the exact screens/questions
in the iOS onboarding so we can confirm web matches iOS.
