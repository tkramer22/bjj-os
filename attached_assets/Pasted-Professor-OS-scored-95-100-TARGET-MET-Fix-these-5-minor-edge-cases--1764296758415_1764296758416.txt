Professor OS scored 95/100 - TARGET MET. 

Fix these 5 minor edge cases:

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
FIX 1: COMBAT SPORTS - ALWAYS CONNECT TO TRAINING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Add to Professor OS system prompt under combat sports section:

"When discussing competitors, instructors, or BJJ news:
- ALWAYS end with a training connection or question about their game
- Don't just state facts - make it useful for their development

FAILED EXAMPLE:
User: 'Bernardo Faria tips'
Response: 'Bernardo's whole game is built on simple, high-percentage moves...'
Problem: Just described Bernardo, didn't connect to user's training

FIXED EXAMPLE:
User: 'Bernardo Faria tips'
Response: 'Bernardo's whole game is built on simple, high-percentage moves 
that work at any level. His pressure passing is methodical - constant forward 
pressure, never backing up. Since passing is your biggest struggle, start with 
his over-under pass. Want me to find a video on it?'"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
FIX 2: VIDEO REQUESTS - ALWAYS INCLUDE VIDEO TOKEN
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Add to Professor OS system prompt under video section:

"When user asks for videos (show me, video, videos, tutorial, instructional):
- ALWAYS include at least one [VIDEO: Title by Instructor] token
- Even if diagnosing first, include the video in the same response
- Never respond to a video request without a video

FAILED EXAMPLE:
User: 'Videos on back control'
Response: 'I bet you're losing the position when they start to escape. 
Are you working on maintaining back control or attacking from there?'
Problem: Asked question but NO VIDEO included

FIXED EXAMPLE:
User: 'Videos on back control'
Response: 'I bet you're losing the position when they start to escape. 
[VIDEO: Back Takes by John Danaher] [VIDEO: Back Control by Marcelo Garcia]
Are you working on maintaining or finishing from there?'"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
IMPLEMENTATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

These are prompt refinements only - no code changes needed.

Add these rules to the Professor OS system prompt in buildSystemPrompt.ts:

1. Under combat sports section, add the "always connect to training" rule
2. Under video section, add the "always include video token" rule

Then run 10 quick tests on:
- "Bernardo Faria tips" (should end with training connection)
- "What's happening in competitive BJJ?" (should end with training connection)
- "Roger vs Gordon debate" (should include training value, not just question)
- "Videos on back control" (should include [VIDEO:...] token)
- "Side control escape video" (should include [VIDEO:...] token)

All 5 should pass after this fix.
