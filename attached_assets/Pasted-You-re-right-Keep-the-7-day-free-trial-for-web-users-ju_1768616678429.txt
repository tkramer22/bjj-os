You’re right. Keep the 7-day free trial for web users, just update the price to $19.99 everywhere.

```
CREATE APPLE-SPECIFIC LEGAL PAGES

We need separate Terms and Privacy pages for iOS App Store compliance. These pages must NOT mention Stripe or 7-day free trial since Apple handles payments differently.

The web pages (/privacy and /terms) should KEEP the 7-day free trial mention but update price to $19.99.
