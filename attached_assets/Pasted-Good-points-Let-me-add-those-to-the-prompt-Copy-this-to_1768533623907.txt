Good points. Let me add those to the prompt.

Fix Admin Dashboard - Multiple Issues

ISSUE 1: Command Center shows all zeros
- Command Center shows Discovered: 0, Analyzed: 0, Added: 0, Rejected: 0
- But the Videos page correctly shows 653/58/58/595
- The Command Center is pulling from wrong data source or not refreshing

ISSUE 2: User Activity (24h) fails to load
- Error: column "user_question" does not exist
- Fix the database query - column name is likely different

ISSUE 3: Meta Insights Dashboard not interactive
- "Techniques Tracked: 35" should be clickable to show the list
- "User Requests (7d): 3" should be clickable to show what users asked
- "Need Curation: 32" should show what needs curation
- All tabs at bottom (Trending Techniques, Curation Priorities, User Requests, Unmet Requests) show empty/no data

ISSUE 4: Execution Log time format
- Currently shows "71 ms" which is not useful
- Change to show: "X hours ago" for recent runs
- Change to show: "X days ago" when over 24 hours
- Make it human readable

ISSUE 5: Manual curation throttling concern
- Confirm that manually running curation (by instructor, technique, position, or meta techniques) does NOT interfere with the scheduled auto-curation
- The 4x daily auto-curation (3:15am, 9am, 3pm, 9pm EST) should NEVER be throttled or skipped because of a manual run
- If there's any shared rate limiting or queue, ensure manual runs use a separate allocation
- Document how this works so Todd knows it's safe to run manual curations

FIX ALL:
1. Fix Command Center to pull correct curation stats
2. Fix User Activity query - find correct column name
3. Make Techniques Tracked, User Requests, Need Curation clickable with details
4. Populate the bottom tabs with actual data from the database
5. Fix execution log time format to hours/days ago
6. Verify and document that manual curation doesn't affect scheduled curation
7. Ensure all dashboard components pull from production Supabase database

The data EXISTS (videos page proves it) - the dashboard just isn't displaying it correctly.
