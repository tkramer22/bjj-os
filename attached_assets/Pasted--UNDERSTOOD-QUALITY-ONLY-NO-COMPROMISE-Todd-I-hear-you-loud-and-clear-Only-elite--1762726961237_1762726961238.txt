# **💎 UNDERSTOOD - QUALITY ONLY, NO COMPROMISE**

Todd, I hear you loud and clear:

**✅ Only elite instruction**  
**✅ No junk, no beginners teaching**  
**✅ Standards stay HIGH**

-----

## **🎯 THE FIX IS SIMPLE:**

Your system is currently **REJECTING Gordon Ryan and Ruotolo Brothers** because the instructor database doesn’t recognize them.

**That’s the ONLY problem.**

We’re not lowering standards. We’re fixing the database so it knows:

- Gordon Ryan = Elite ✅
- Ruotolo Brothers = Elite ✅
- Random purple belt = Reject ❌

-----

## **📋 COPY THIS SINGLE PROMPT TO REPLIT AGENT:**

```
The quality threshold at 70+ is correct - DO NOT lower it.

The problem is the instructor credibility database is not recognizing elite instructors.

Update the trusted_instructors table to include these world-class instructors:

ELITE TIER (Auto-accept if instructional):
- John Danaher
- Gordon Ryan
- Garry Tonon
- Craig Jones
- Lachlan Giles
- Bernardo Faria
- Marcelo Garcia
- Roger Gracie
- Demian Maia
- Tye Ruotolo
- Kade Ruotolo
- Mikey Musumeci
- Buchecha
- Andre Galvao
- JT Torres
- Xande Ribeiro
- Rafael Lovato Jr.
- Lucas Lepri
- Felipe Pena
- Leandro Lo
- Nicholas Meregali

Scoring rules (DO NOT CHANGE):
- Video must be clearly instructional (not competition footage)
- Video must have clear audio and demonstration
- Overall quality score must be 70+
- Elite instructors get higher credibility scores

MAINTAIN HIGH STANDARDS. Only accept true instructional content from proven instructors.

Run manual test again and verify:
1. Gordon Ryan instructional videos now ACCEPT
2. Ruotolo Brothers instructional videos now ACCEPT
3. Random unknown instructors still REJECT
4. Competition footage with no instruction still REJECT

Show me the results.
```

## **✅ THIS MAINTAINS YOUR STANDARDS:**

**What WILL be accepted:**

- ✅ Gordon Ryan teaching guard passing
- ✅ Danaher teaching back attacks
- ✅ Ruotolo Brothers teaching leg locks

**What will STILL be rejected:**

- ❌ Competition footage with no instruction
- ❌ Unknown purple belts teaching
- ❌ Poor quality videos
- ❌ Non-instructional content

-----

**Copy that prompt and send it. This fixes the instructor recognition while keeping standards at 70+.** 🎯​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
