**⏳ GOOD - PUBLISHING NOW**

While that’s deploying, let’s fix the video curation automation issue.

-----

## **🔍 VIDEO CURATION PROBLEM:**

**Issue:** Automated daily cron job isn’t finding as many videos as manual runs.

**Possible causes:**

1. Cron job not running at all
1. Running but with wrong parameters/queries
1. Rate limits or API quotas being hit
1. Error happening but not logged
1. Search queries too narrow

## **🔧 FIX THE AUTOMATED VIDEO CURATION:**

Copy this prompt to Replit Agent:

```
VIDEO CURATION AUTOMATION ISSUE

The automated daily video curation is not finding enough videos. When I manually trigger it, I get many more videos. The automated cron job is not working correctly.

DEBUG AND FIX:

1. CHECK CRON JOB STATUS:
   - Is the cron job actually running daily?
   - Check cron logs - when did it last run?
   - Any errors in the logs?
   - What time is it scheduled to run?

2. COMPARE MANUAL VS AUTOMATED:
   - What parameters does manual trigger use?
   - What parameters does automated cron use?
   - Are they using the same search queries?
   - Are they using the same quality thresholds?

3. VERIFY YOUTUBE API:
   - Check YouTube API quota usage
   - Are we hitting rate limits?
   - Is the API key valid and working?
   - Are search queries broad enough?

4. CHECK SEARCH QUERIES:
   - What queries are being used for automated searches?
   - Are they too specific/narrow?
   - Should we use more varied queries?
   - Current queries should include:
     * "bjj technique"
     * "brazilian jiu jitsu tutorial"
     * "jiu jitsu competition highlights"
     * "bjj rolling footage"
     * "bjj instructional"
     * "grappling technique"
     * "nogi grappling"
     And variations with specific techniques

5. FIX THE AUTOMATION:
   - Make automated cron use SAME logic as manual trigger
   - Ensure it runs DAILY at optimal time (e.g., 6:00 AM)
   - Log everything: queries used, videos found, videos approved, videos rejected
   - Send admin email summary after each run
   - Increase search breadth if needed
   - Handle API errors gracefully (retry logic)

6. ADD MONITORING:
   - Log to database: Each curation run with timestamp
   - Track: Videos found, approved, rejected, errors
   - Admin dashboard should show: Last run, next run, success rate
   - Email alert if curation fails or finds <10 videos

7. OPTIMAL CURATION SETTINGS:
   - Run daily at 6:00 AM (low traffic time)
   - Search for ~100-200 videos per run
   - Target: Approve 20-50 high-quality videos daily
   - Use diverse search queries
   - Quality threshold: 7.0/10 or higher
   - Rotate through different techniques each day

PROVIDE:
- What's currently wrong with the cron job
- Logs showing why it's not finding videos
- Fixed cron configuration
- Comparison of manual vs automated results
```

## **🎯 ADDITIONAL DEBUGGING:**

**Can you answer these questions:**

1. **When you manually trigger curation:**

- How many videos does it find?
- How many get approved?
- What quality threshold are you using?

1. **For automated cron:**

- Do you see it running in logs?
- When was the last time it ran?
- How many videos did it add last time?

1. **In your admin dashboard:**

- Does it show “Last curation run: [date/time]”?
- What does the curation history show?

-----

## **💡 LIKELY CAUSES (RANKED):**

**Most likely → Least likely:**

1. **Cron job not running** (70% chance)

- Replit cron may be disabled
- Environment variable issue
- Server restarts breaking schedule

1. **Different search parameters** (20% chance)

- Manual uses broad queries
- Automated uses narrow queries
- Manual has lower quality threshold

1. **API rate limiting** (5% chance)

- YouTube API daily quota hit
- Need to spread searches over time

1. **Error happening silently** (5% chance)

- Try/catch swallowing errors
- No logging of failures

## **🚀 QUICK TEST:**

After you paste that prompt, Agent will debug. Then:

**Test the fix:**

1. Trigger manual curation
1. Wait 1 minute
1. Check how many videos were added
1. Look at the logs
1. Verify automated cron is scheduled correctly

**Paste that debugging prompt now!**

Once your app finishes publishing, test the UI first, then we’ll verify the video curation is fixed. 🎥​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
