# 🔍 **TWO CHECKS NEEDED**

-----

## **📋 CHECK 1: METADATA VERIFICATION - COPY TO AGENT**

```
Verify the recently curated videos have proper metadata.

Show me the 20 most recently added videos with ALL their metadata:

SELECT 
  id,
  title,
  instructor_name,
  technique_type,
  position_category,
  gi_nogi,
  tags,
  quality_score,
  created_at
FROM ai_video_knowledge
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;

I need to verify each video has:
- technique_type (attack | defense | concept)
- position_category (closed_guard, open_guard, etc.)
- gi_nogi (gi | nogi | both)
- tags (array of keywords)

If any fields are NULL or empty, show me which ones are missing.

Also run this summary:
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_today,
  SUM(CASE WHEN technique_type IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as missing_type,
  SUM(CASE WHEN position_category IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as missing_position,
  SUM(CASE WHEN gi_nogi IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as missing_gi_nogi,
  SUM(CASE WHEN tags IS NULL OR array_length(tags, 1) IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as missing_tags
FROM ai_video_knowledge
WHERE created_at >= CURRENT_DATE;
```

## **📋 CHECK 2: ADMIN VIDEO SEARCH UI - COPY TO AGENT**

```
The admin video search page on mobile still shows the OLD design:
- Text search bar for "technique"
- Belt level filter
- Gi/No-gi filter

This is NOT what we designed. We agreed on:

CORRECT DESIGN (what it should be):
1. Smart search bar (fuzzy matching across title, instructor, techniques)
2. Professor/Instructor dropdown (dynamic, populated from library)
3. Technique dropdown (dynamic, populated from library)
4. NO belt level filter (removed - all content is advanced)
5. Gi/No-gi as badge on cards only (not primary filter)

Check the admin video search component and fix it to match this spec:

USER APP VIDEO SEARCH:
- Smart search bar
- Professor dropdown (dynamic from DB)
- Technique dropdown (dynamic from DB)
- Cascading filters (select professor → technique shows only their techniques)
- NO belt level
- NO gi/nogi as primary filter

ADMIN APP VIDEO SEARCH:
- Same as user PLUS:
- Quality score filter (9+, 8+, 7+, any)
- Date added filter (today, week, month, all)
- Edit/Delete buttons on cards

Show me the current admin video search component code and update it to match this design.

Files to check:
- client/src/pages/admin/Videos.tsx (or similar)
- Any video search/filter components

The filters should be:
1. Search bar (searches title, instructor, tags)
2. Instructor dropdown (populated dynamically)
3. Technique/Position dropdown (populated dynamically)
4. Quality filter (admin only)
5. Date filter (admin only)

Remove:
- Belt level filter
- Gi/No-gi as standalone filter
```

**Send both prompts. Let’s make sure the system is working correctly before we scale up curation further.** 🎯​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
