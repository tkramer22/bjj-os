You’re right. The Professor OS rules are NOT being followed:

**What’s WRONG:**

1. ❌ Says “I don’t have guillotine instructionals” - FALSE, we verified 11+ exist
1. ❌ Didn’t share video FIRST - user had to ask “Any videos?”
1. ❌ No instructor quotes cited
1. ❌ Videos shared are WRONG - “Escape Closed Guard to Ashi Garami” and “Single Leg X” have nothing to do with guillotines
1. ❌ Tells user to “hit YouTube” - unacceptable when we have a 3,000 video library

CRITICAL: PROFESSOR OS PROMPT NOT WORKING - RULES NOT BEING FOLLOWED

The Professor OS elite coaching rules we just deployed are NOT being followed.

EVIDENCE FROM TESTING:

1. USER ASKED: "Any guillotine pointers"
   PROFESSOR OS SAID: "I don't have guillotine instructionals in my library yet"
   REALITY: We verified earlier there are 11+ guillotine videos from Marcelo, Danaher, Garry Tonon, Craig Jones

2. NO VIDEO SHARED PROACTIVELY
   Rule says: ALWAYS share at least one video with technique discussions
   Professor OS gave detailed tips but NO video until user asked "Any videos?"

3. NO INSTRUCTOR QUOTES
   Rule says: Cite instructor tips in quotes like "As Danaher explains: '...'"
   Professor OS gave generic tips with no citations

4. WRONG VIDEOS RECOMMENDED
   When it finally shared videos, they were:
   - "Escape Closed Guard to Ashi Garami" - NOT about guillotines
   - "Single Leg X Entry and Sweep" - NOT about guillotines
   These have ZERO relevance to the question

5. TOLD USER TO GO TO YOUTUBE
   Professor OS said: "you might need to hit YouTube for now"
   This is UNACCEPTABLE. We have 3,000 videos. Never send users away.

THE PROMPT IS NOT BEING INJECTED OR FOLLOWED

Either:
A) The system prompt update didn't deploy to production
B) The video search is not querying the right fields
C) The relevance matching is completely broken

FIX REQUIRED:

1. Verify the Professor OS system prompt in PRODUCTION contains the elite coaching rules

2. Fix video search to ACTUALLY find guillotine videos when user asks about guillotines
   - Search: title, techniqueName, tags, keyConcepts, techniques_covered
   - Query: "guillotine" OR "choke" OR "front headlock" OR "neck"

3. NEVER say "I don't have videos" when videos exist
   - Run the search FIRST
   - Only say you don't have videos if search returns 0 results

4. NEVER recommend irrelevant videos
   - Single Leg X is not related to guillotines
   - Closed Guard escape is not related to guillotines
   - Match TECHNIQUE first, instructor second

5. NEVER tell users to go to YouTube

Test with: "Show me guillotine videos"
Expected: Return ONLY videos about guillotines/chokes from the library

This is our core product. Fix it permanently.
