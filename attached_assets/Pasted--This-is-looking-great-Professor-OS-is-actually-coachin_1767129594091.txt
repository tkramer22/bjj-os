**This is looking great!** Professor OS is actually coaching really well - connecting the armbar to the guillotine work, recommending Roger Gracie content, giving actionable drilling advice. That’s premium coaching.

**Here’s the prompt to fix the remaining issues:**

```
FIX THREE ISSUES - PROFESSOR OS, TRAINING STYLE, VIDEO THUMBNAILS

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ISSUE 1: PROFESSOR OS TONE - REMOVE THE CRITICISM
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Professor OS is being slightly judgmental in the opening. When the user logs training, the response starts with criticism like "You just told me yesterday you'd focus on guillotines for two weeks... here we are again" and "this is exactly the pattern."

FIX: Professor OS should NEVER criticize the user for training what their coach shows in class. Following your coach's curriculum is correct behavior, not a pattern to call out.

Update the Professor OS system prompt to:
- Always be supportive and encouraging when user logs training
- NEVER guilt the user for changing focus or following class curriculum
- Frame connections positively: "Nice - armbar from headlock actually connects to your guillotine work" instead of pointing out they're not sticking to a plan
- Be a supportive training partner, not a disappointed parent
- Save direct feedback for when the user explicitly asks "what am I doing wrong" or "give me honest feedback"

The coaching CONTENT is excellent (connecting armbar to guillotine, Roger Gracie video, drilling advice). Just fix the TONE to be supportive first.

ISSUE 2: TRAINING STYLE - ADD "BOTH" OPTION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

In Profile settings, the "Style" selector only shows:
- Gi
- No-Gi

Add a third option:
- Both

Most BJJ practitioners train both. This should be the most common selection.

Update:
1. The style picker/dropdown to include "Both" as an option
2. Database to accept "both" as a valid value
3. Any validation that checks style values

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ISSUE 3: VIDEO THUMBNAIL PLACEHOLDER
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

When Professor OS recommends a video in chat, the thumbnail area is blank/empty (showing just a play button on white/gray background).

FIX: If no YouTube thumbnail is available, show the BJJ OS logo as a placeholder instead of a blank space.

Options in order of preference:
1. Load the actual YouTube thumbnail (should already be doing this)
2. If YouTube thumbnail fails to load, show BJJ OS logo as fallback
3. Never show a blank/empty thumbnail area

Check why the YouTube thumbnail isn't loading:
- Is the thumbnail URL being passed correctly?
- Is there a CORS or loading issue?
- Is the img src empty?

If thumbnails can't load reliably, use the BJJ OS logo as the default placeholder.

TESTING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

After fixes:

1. TONE TEST: Send "We worked on knee cuts today" 
   - Should get supportive response, no criticism about changing focus
   
2. STYLE TEST: Go to Profile > Style
   - Should see three options: Gi, No-Gi, Both
   
3. THUMBNAIL TEST: Ask Professor OS for a video recommendation
   - Should see either YouTube thumbnail OR BJJ OS logo placeholder
   - Should NOT see blank/empty space
