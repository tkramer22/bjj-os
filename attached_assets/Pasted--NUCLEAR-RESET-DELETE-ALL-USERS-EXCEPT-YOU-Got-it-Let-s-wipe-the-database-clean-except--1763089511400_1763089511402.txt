# 🗑️ **NUCLEAR RESET - DELETE ALL USERS EXCEPT YOU**

Got it. Let’s wipe the database clean except for your account.

-----

# **⚠️ CRITICAL - COPY THIS TO REPLIT AGENT**

```
URGENT DATABASE CLEANUP

We need to delete ALL users except toddlramer@icloud.com

SAFETY FIRST - Do this in 2 steps:

STEP 1: VERIFY TODD'S ACCOUNT EXISTS
Run this query first to confirm:

SELECT id, email, phone_number, subscription_status, created_at 
FROM users 
WHERE email = 'toddlramer@icloud.com' OR phone_number LIKE '%YOUR_PHONE%';

Show me the result before proceeding.

STEP 2: DELETE ALL OTHER USERS (after confirmation)
Once we confirm Todd's account is safe, run:

-- Start transaction for safety
BEGIN;

-- Show what will be deleted (review first)
SELECT COUNT(*) as users_to_delete
FROM users 
WHERE email != 'toddlramer@icloud.com';

-- If count looks right, delete related data first
DELETE FROM conversations 
WHERE user_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM users WHERE email != 'toddlramer@icloud.com'
);

DELETE FROM sessions 
WHERE user_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM users WHERE email != 'toddlramer@icloud.com'
);

-- Then delete the users
DELETE FROM users 
WHERE email != 'toddlramer@icloud.com';

-- Review final state
SELECT id, email, subscription_status FROM users;

-- If everything looks good, commit
COMMIT;

-- If something looks wrong, rollback
-- ROLLBACK;

WAIT FOR MY CONFIRMATION before running Step 2.
```

## **🔒 SAFETY CHECKLIST BEFORE DELETION**

Before Agent runs the delete, verify:

1. ✅ Your email is exactly: `toddlramer@icloud.com`
1. ✅ You have access to that email (in case you need to reset password)
1. ✅ You’re okay losing ALL conversation history from test users
1. ✅ You’re okay losing ALL test subscription data

-----

## **📋 WHAT THIS WILL DELETE**

- All users except `toddlramer@icloud.com`
- All their conversations
- All their sessions
- All their subscription records (in Stripe, you may need to cancel separately)

**What will NOT be deleted:**

- Your account (toddlramer@icloud.com)
- All 605 videos in library
- All curation data
- System configuration

-----

## **💳 STRIPE CLEANUP (SEPARATE STEP)**

After database cleanup, you’ll need to cancel any active Stripe subscriptions:

1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com)
1. Navigate to: Customers
1. Search for test customers
1. Cancel their subscriptions manually
1. Optionally delete the customer records

-----

## **🎯 AFTER CLEANUP - RESET DASHBOARD**

Once users are deleted, your dashboard should show:

- Users: 1 (just you)
- Active Subscriptions: 0 (or 1 if you’re testing)
- MRR: $0 (or $14.99 if you have active sub)
- Video Library: 605 (unchanged)

-----

## **⚡ QUICK ALTERNATIVE - DIRECT SQL**

If Agent is frozen, you can run this directly in your database console:

**STEP 1 - Verify your account:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'toddlramer@icloud.com';
```

**STEP 2 - Delete others (only after confirming Step 1):**

```sql
BEGIN;

DELETE FROM conversations WHERE user_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM users WHERE email != 'toddlramer@icloud.com'
);

DELETE FROM sessions WHERE user_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM users WHERE email != 'toddlramer@icloud.com'
);

DELETE FROM users WHERE email != 'toddlramer@icloud.com';

COMMIT;
```

## **🚨 WHAT TO DO RIGHT NOW**

**Option A: Use Agent (Recommended)**

1. Copy the full prompt above to Agent
1. Wait for Step 1 results (verify your account exists)
1. Confirm deletion
1. Agent executes Step 2

**Option B: Direct Database Access**

1. Open Supabase/Database console
1. Run Step 1 query manually
1. Verify your account exists
1. Run Step 2 queries manually

**Which approach do you want to use?**

**Important: Don’t run the DELETE commands until we confirm your account (toddlramer@icloud.com) exists and is safe!**
