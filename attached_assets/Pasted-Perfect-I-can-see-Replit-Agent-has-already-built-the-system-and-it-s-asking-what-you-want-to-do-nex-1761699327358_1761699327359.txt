Perfect! I can see Replit Agent has already built the system and it’s asking what you want to do next.

Here’s what I recommend telling the agent:

```
Option 2: Update specific parts of the existing system

CRITICAL UPDATES NEEDED:

1. UPDATE EMAIL TEMPLATE
   - Replace the current email with the EXACT template I provided
   - Subject: "Your BJJ OS lifetime access"
   - From: "Todd - BJJ OS" <noreply@bjjos.app>
   - Reply-To: todd@bjjos.app
   - Use the HTML and plain text versions I specified
   - The email must match EXACTLY - it's very personal and specific

2. REMOVE PHONE NUMBER REQUIREMENT
   - The system should be 100% email-based
   - No phone numbers anywhere in the UI or database
   - Admin panel should only ask for email, not phone

3. REMOVE DUAL VALIDATION
   - No email verification code needed
   - Token validation is sufficient
   - User clicks link → validates token → creates account → done

4. UPDATE ADMIN DASHBOARD
   - Admin panel should be at /admin/lifetime-access (or /admin/lifetime)
   - Form should have:
     • Email input (required)
     • Personal message textarea (optional)
     • Reason dropdown (founding_member, beta_tester, special_contributor, vip, partnership, other)
     • Admin notes textarea (optional, internal only)
     • Expiration dropdown (7, 14, 30, 60, 90 days - default 14)
   - NO phone number fields

5. SIMPLIFY USER FLOW
   - User receives email → clicks link → sees signup form
   - Signup form has: email (pre-filled, readonly), display name, username, password
   - Submit button: "Activate Lifetime Access"
   - On success: create account with lifetime_access=true, is_founding_member=true
   - Redirect to /onboarding

6. UPDATE MAGIC LINK
   - Format: https://bjjos.app/lifetime-signup?token={token}
   - NOT /auth/signup-with-invite or any other path
   - Use /lifetime-signup specifically

MOST IMPORTANT: Replace the email template with my exact specification. The current one is too generic - mine is personal, from Todd, with his contact info, and explains the product correctly.

After making these updates, show me:
1. The updated email template code
2. The admin panel form
3. The signup page

Then we can test end-to-end.
```

This will tell the agent to:

1. ✅ Use YOUR exact email copy (the personal one from Todd)
1. ✅ Remove phone numbers completely
1. ✅ Simplify the flow (no dual validation)
1. ✅ Fix the admin panel UI
1. ✅ Make it ready for your beta testers

**Paste this into the Replit Agent prompt and let it make these critical updates!** 🚀​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
