# 🎉 **PERFECT - EVERYTHING FIXED AND WORKING!**

Agent crushed it. Let me break down what you now have, then give you the test prompts.

-----

## **✅ WHAT AGENT JUST FIXED**

### **THREE MAJOR FIXES:**

1. **CURATION RE-ENABLED** ✅

- Was disabled since Oct 22 (`auto_curation_enabled = false`)
- Now enabled in database
- Next run in ~10 minutes (4:00 PM EST)
- Then 9 daily runs automatically

1. **EMAIL DATA BUGS FIXED** ✅

- Was using `upload_date` (YouTube 2017-2023) instead of `created_at` (when added to library)
- All 10 timezone queries fixed to EST
- Now shows accurate data

1. **COMBAT SPORTS CONFIRMED** ✅

- **48 articles scraped today** from 6 sources
- Runs daily at 6:00 AM EST
- **✅ IS integrated into Professor OS** (last 7 days of BJJ news in system prompt)

## **🥋 COMBAT SPORTS SCRAPING - WHAT’S BEING SCRAPED**

Agent confirmed it’s working but didn’t show full details. Let’s get that now.

TASK 1: Show Combat Sports Scraping Details

I need to know EXACTLY what's being scraped for Professor OS.

SHOW ME:

1. SOURCES BEING SCRAPED
   List all 6 sources with URLs:
   - Source name
   - Website URL
   - Type of content (news, events, rankings, etc)
   - How often it's scraped

2. WHAT DATA IS EXTRACTED
   For each article scraped, show me what fields are saved:
   - Title
   - Summary/excerpt
   - Publication date
   - Author
   - Tags/categories
   - Event info (if applicable)
   - Fighter/competitor names (if applicable)
   - What else?

3. HOW IT'S STORED
   Show me the database table structure:
   ```sql
   SELECT column_name, data_type 
   FROM information_schema.columns 
   WHERE table_name = 'combat_sports_articles'
   ORDER BY ordinal_position;
```

1. SAMPLE DATA
   Show me 5 recent articles with full data:
   
   ```sql
   SELECT * 
   FROM combat_sports_articles 
   ORDER BY created_at DESC 
   LIMIT 5;
   ```
1. PROFESSOR OS INTEGRATION
   Show me the EXACT part of Professor OS system prompt that includes combat sports news.

- How is it formatted?
- How many days of history included?
- Example of how it appears in the prompt

1. USAGE VERIFICATION
   Search Professor OS conversation history for examples where combat sports news was mentioned in a response.

- Show me 2-3 real examples
- Prove it’s actually being used, not just in the prompt

Provide complete details on all 6 points.

TASK 2: Run Manual Test Curation (Monitor Mode)

Run ONE curation cycle manually right now to verify everything works.

REQUIREMENTS:

1. Run in MONITORING MODE - show detailed logs of what’s happening
1. Don’t interfere with scheduled runs (this is a one-time test)
1. Target: 10-20 videos discovered and processed
1. Show real-time progress

EXECUTE:

```javascript
// Manual test curation with full logging
console.log('🧪 STARTING TEST CURATION RUN');
console.log('Time:', new Date().toLocaleString('en-US', { timeZone: 'America/New_York' }));

const testResults = await runAggressiveCuration({
  testMode: true,
  maxSearches: 5,  // Just 5 searches for quick test
  verbose: true     // Full logging
});

console.log('\n📊 TEST CURATION RESULTS:');
console.log('─'.repeat(50));
console.log(`Videos Discovered: ${testResults.discovered}`);
console.log(`Videos Analyzed: ${testResults.analyzed}`);
console.log(`Videos Approved: ${testResults.approved}`);
console.log(`Videos Rejected: ${testResults.rejected}`);
console.log(`Approval Rate: ${testResults.approvalRate}%`);
console.log(`API Quota Used: ${testResults.quotaUsed}`);
console.log(`Time Taken: ${testResults.duration}ms`);
console.log('─'.repeat(50));

if (testResults.approved > 0) {
  console.log('\n✅ TOP VIDEOS ADDED:');
  testResults.topVideos.forEach((v, i) => {
    console.log(`${i+1}. ${v.title}`);
    console.log(`   Instructor: ${v.instructor}`);
    console.log(`   Quality: ${v.qualityScore}/10`);
  });
}

console.log('\n🎯 NEXT SCHEDULED RUN: 4:00 PM EST');
```

AFTER TEST COMPLETES:

1. Verify videos were actually added to database
1. Check they appear in library
1. Confirm quality scores >= 7.0
1. Show sample of what was added

Report back with full results.
