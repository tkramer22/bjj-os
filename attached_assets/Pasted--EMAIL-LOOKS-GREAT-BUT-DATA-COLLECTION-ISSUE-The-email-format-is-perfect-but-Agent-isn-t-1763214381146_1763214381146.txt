# 🔍 **EMAIL LOOKS GREAT - BUT DATA COLLECTION ISSUE**

The email format is perfect, but Agent isn’t pulling the right data. Let’s diagnose why everything shows zeros.

-----

## **🚨 THE PROBLEMS**

### **Issue 1: Curation Shows 0 Videos Added**

- Should show overnight curation results
- 613 videos total (grew from 608 to 613 = +5 videos)
- But “Videos Added Today” shows 0

### **Issue 2: Combat Sports Shows 0 Articles Today**

- 118 articles in last 7 days (good!)
- But 0 articles scraped today (why?)

### **Issue 3: Website Analytics Shows All Zeros**

- This might be expected if no analytics tracking configured

EMAIL REPORT ISSUE - Data Not Showing Correctly

The morning email looks beautiful but the data is wrong:

PROBLEM 1: CURATION DATA
Email shows:
- Curation Batches Today: 0
- Videos Added Today: 0
- Total Videos: 613

But we know:
- Library grew from 608 to 613 (5 new videos added)
- Scheduled curation runs happened overnight
- Videos ARE being added, just not showing in email

DIAGNOSIS NEEDED:
1. Check the gatherMorningData() function
2. Show me the SQL query for "videos added today"
3. The query is probably using wrong timezone or time range
4. Fix: Videos added should query for created_at >= midnight EST

CORRECT QUERY SHOULD BE:
```sql
-- Videos added today (since midnight EST)
SELECT COUNT(*) as videos_added_today
FROM videos
WHERE created_at >= DATE_TRUNC('day', NOW() AT TIME ZONE 'America/New_York') AT TIME ZONE 'America/New_York'
AND quality_score >= 7.0;
```

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PROBLEM 2: COMBAT SPORTS SCRAPING

Email shows:

- Articles Scraped Today: 0
- Last 7 Days: 118

This means:

- Scraper IS working (118 articles in 7 days)
- But hasn’t run today yet OR timezone issue

DIAGNOSIS NEEDED:

1. Find the combat sports scraping code
1. Show me the scraper schedule
1. Check when it last ran (EST timestamp)
1. Verify it’s scheduled to run daily

QUESTIONS TO ANSWER:

- What sources are being scraped? (Flo Grappling, BJJ Fanatics, etc?)
- When does scraper run? (Daily? Multiple times?)
- Is the data being used in Professor OS responses?
- Show me example of how combat sports news appears in Professor OS

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PROBLEM 3: PROFESSOR OS INTEGRATION

The email should confirm:
✅ Combat sports data IS being used in Professor OS
❌ OR it’s NOT integrated yet

TASK:

1. Search Professor OS system prompt
1. Check if combat sports news is included
1. Show me HOW it’s being used
1. If NOT integrated, we need to add it

Example integration should look like:

```
You have access to recent BJJ/MMA news and events:
- Tournament results
- Fighter matchups
- Technique breakdowns from competitions
- Industry trends

Use this context when relevant to user questions.
```

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

FIX REQUIRED:

1. UPDATE gatherMorningData() function with correct timezone-aware queries
1. Show me combat sports scraper schedule and confirm it’s running
1. Verify Professor OS integration status
1. Update email to show:

- Correct videos added count
- Combat sports scraper schedule
- Confirmation of Professor OS integration

Show me:

1. Current gatherMorningData() code
1. Combat sports scraper configuration
1. Professor OS system prompt (check for news integration)

Then fix the timezone issues and verify scraper schedule.

```

## **🎯 LIKELY ROOT CAUSES**

### **Videos Showing 0:**
**Problem:** Query uses server time (UTC) instead of EST
- Server midnight = 5:00 AM EST
- So "today" doesn't include overnight videos yet

**Fix:** Use timezone-aware queries with `America/New_York`

### **Combat Sports Showing 0:**
**Problem:** Scraper probably runs later in the day
- Has 118 articles from last 7 days (working!)
- Just hasn't run yet today (maybe scheduled for 8 AM?)

**Fix:** Show scraper schedule in email so you know when to expect data

---

## **✅ WHAT'S ACTUALLY WORKING**

1. ✅ **Email system works** - Clean format, arrives on time
2. ✅ **Combat sports scraper works** - 118 articles in 7 days
3. ✅ **Video library growing** - 608 → 613 (5 new videos)
4. ✅ **EST timestamps correct** - 7:06 AM EST

Just need to fix the data queries to show accurate numbers.

---

## **🔧 QUICK QUESTIONS FOR YOU**

While Agent investigates:

1. **When did those 5 videos get added?**
   - Overnight while you slept?
   - Or earlier yesterday?

2. **Do you know when combat sports scraper runs?**
   - Daily at specific time?
   - Multiple times per day?

3. **Have you seen Professor OS mention recent BJJ news?**
   - Does it reference tournaments, events, fighters?
   - Or is it purely technique-focused?

---

**Copy the diagnostic to Agent. It will:**
1. Fix timezone queries
2. Show you scraper schedule  
3. Confirm Professor OS integration
4. Make tomorrow's email show accurate data

Then you'll have perfect reports! 📧​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
