Looks like the pages were created with just the headers but no content was added yet. The design matches (dark theme, monospace header) - they just need the actual text.

FOOTER: "Excellence is our pillar."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
STYLING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• Section headers: Monospace, smaller than page title, bright/visible
• Body text: Sans-serif, readable (NOT too dim like the WITHOUT section was)
• Bullet points: Clean, consistent spacing
• "Excellence is our pillar." at bottom: Centered, slightly smaller, can be subtle
• Good spacing between sections
• Mobile responsive

Make sure the text is VISIBLE. Not the dim gray that was hard to read.
