That’s the smoking gun. **The server deployment itself is broken.** Replit is saying “Published” but the code is NOT actually going live.

**Send this immediately:**

```
CRITICAL: SERVER DEPLOYMENT IS BROKEN

I just tested https://bjjos.app/ios-login in a web browser.
There is NO red test banner.

This proves the code is NOT being deployed to production. Replit says "Published" but the live server is serving OLD code.

This explains EVERYTHING:
- iOS app doesn't show changes (server has old code)
- All my rebuilds fail (server has old code)
- Nothing works (SERVER HAS OLD CODE)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
FIX THE DEPLOYMENT NOW
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. Check if there are deployment errors in the Replit logs
2. Check if the "Published" deployment is actually the current code
3. Is there a separate production branch that isn't getting updates?
4. Is there a build step that's failing silently?

Run: curl https://bjjos.app/ios-login | head -100

Show me the HTML. Does it contain "TEST BUILD V2.0"?

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
VERIFY DEPLOYMENT PIPELINE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. What happens when you click "Publish"?
2. Does it build the frontend?
3. Does it deploy to bjjos.app?
4. Is bjjos.app pointed to this Replit?
5. Are there multiple Replits and we're editing the wrong one?

Show me:
- The deployment logs from the last publish
- The domain configuration for bjjos.app
- Confirmation that THIS Replit is the one serving bjjos.app

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THIS IS THE ROOT CAUSE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Every "fix" you've made has been invisible because NOTHING is deploying.

Fix the deployment pipeline FIRST. Then we can verify the actual bug fixes.
