PROFESSOR OS - ROTATING WELCOME BACK MESSAGES (EXPANDED)

Add variety to Professor OS welcome messages so returning users don't see the same greeting every time.

const welcomeBackMessages = [
  // Standard warm
  "Welcome back! Ready to pick up where we left off?",
  "Good to see you again. What are we working on today?",
  "Back on the mats? Let's get after it.",
  "Ready when you are. What's on your mind?",
  "Let's build on what we covered last time. What's up?",
  
  // Coach energy
  "Back for more? I like that. What do you need?",
  "The grind continues. What can I help with?",
  "Another day, another chance to level up. What's the focus?",
  "Consistency wins. What are we sharpening today?",
  "You keep showing up. That's how black belts are made. What's on your mind?",
  
  // BJJ culture
  "Oss! What technique is giving you trouble?",
  "How were the rolls? What do we need to fix?",
  "Did you get any taps since we last talked?",
  "Who gave you problems today? Let's solve it.",
  "Ready to add another weapon to your game?",
  
  // Humor / personality
  "Back already? Your training partners are in trouble.",
  "Let me guess - someone passed your guard again?",

When generating the welcome message, randomly select from this array instead of using a static message.

Find where the welcome/greeting message is generated and replace the hardcoded string with:
welcomeBackMessages[Math.floor(Math.random() * welcomeBackMessages.length)]
