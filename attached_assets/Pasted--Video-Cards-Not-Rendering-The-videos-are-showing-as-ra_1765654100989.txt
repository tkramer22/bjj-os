# Video Cards Not Rendering

The videos are showing as raw text instead of actual video cards:

```
[VIDEO: Back Take Escape Options - Andre Galvao | Andre Galvao | START: 00:00]
```

This means the video component isn’t rendering — Professor OS is outputting text references instead of triggering the video card UI.

CRITICAL FIX: Videos Not Rendering as Cards

Professor OS is outputting video references as plain text like:
[VIDEO: Back Take Escape Options - Andre Galvao | Andre Galvao | START: 00:00]

Instead of rendering actual clickable video cards with thumbnails.

THE PROBLEM:
The video data is being returned as raw text in the chat response instead of being parsed and rendered as video card components.

FIX THIS:

1. Find where Professor OS outputs video recommendations in the response

2. Videos should NOT be inline text — they need to be parsed and rendered as separate VideoCard components

3. Check the response parsing logic:
   - When Professor OS returns a video reference, it should be detected
   - Extract: video title, instructor, video ID/URL, timestamp
   - Pass this data to a VideoCard component
   - Render the VideoCard in the chat UI (not as text)

4. The flow should be:
   - Professor OS returns structured video data (JSON or tagged format)
   - Frontend parses the response
   - Text goes to chat bubble
   - Videos render as VideoCard components with:
     - Thumbnail image
     - Title
     - Instructor name
     - Watch button
     - Save/bookmark button

5. Check if you have a VideoCard component — if not, create one

6. Ensure the parser is looking for video references and extracting them from the response before rendering

7. Test by asking Professor OS a technique question and confirm videos render as cards, not text

DO NOT output video references as plain text in the chat. They must render as interactive video cards.
