Fix two issues across the BJJ OS site:

## 1. UPDATE LOGO EVERYWHERE

The logo file is at /bjjos-logo.png in the public folder.

Replace ALL placeholder logos, text-only logos, or existing logo images with:

<img src="/bjjos-logo.png" alt="BJJ OS" className="h-9 w-auto" />

Make the logo clickable and link to the homepage "/" on every page.

Update these locations:
- Navigation/header component (all pages)
- Footer (if logo exists there)
- Login page
- Signup page  
- Dashboard
- Landing page
- Any other pages showing a logo

Use h-9 (36px height) for navigation, h-7 (28px) for footer.
