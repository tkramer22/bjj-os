## **UPDATED VIDEO LIBRARY FIX - WITH AUTO MODE & DASHBOARD:**

Tell Replit Agent:

```
Enhance the Video Library admin page with metadata, auto-curation controls, and comprehensive analytics dashboard:

PART 1 - ADD VIDEO METADATA & TIMESTAMPS:

1. EXPAND VIDEO DATA MODEL:
Add these fields to the video database table:
- key_timestamps: JSON array of {time: "2:35", description: "Hip escape detail", importance: "high"}
- best_for_level: Array ["white", "blue"] 
- when_to_watch: Enum ["before_drilling", "after_class", "pre_competition", "injury_recovery"]
- prerequisite_techniques: Array of technique IDs
- follow_up_techniques: Array of technique IDs
- common_mistakes_timestamp: "5:20"
- setup_timestamp: "0:45"
- execution_timestamp: "2:10"
- troubleshooting_timestamp: "6:30"

2. VIDEO DETAIL VIEW:
When clicking "Full Video" button, show expanded modal with:
- Video player with timestamp navigation
- List of key moments (clickable to jump to that time)
- "Best watched: Before drilling this technique"
- Prerequisite techniques (with links)
- Follow-up techniques (with links)
- Admin edit button to modify all metadata

3. AI TIMESTAMP EXTRACTION:
When curating videos, have the AI analyze the transcript and extract:
- Key teaching moments with timestamps
- When the instructor demonstrates vs explains
- Common mistakes section timestamp
- Drilling tips timestamp
- Automatically populate the metadata fields

PART 2 - AUTO-CURATION CONTROL PANEL WITH ON/OFF SWITCH:

Add a new "Auto-Curation Dashboard" section at the top of the Video Library page:

5. NOTIFICATIONS & ALERTS:
- SMS admin when curation completes: "BJJ OS: Auto-curation added 5 videos (8.2 avg quality)"
- Alert if acceptance rate drops below threshold: "⚠️ Only 3.2% acceptance - may need to adjust settings"
- Alert if curation finds 0 videos: "⚠️ No new videos found - check search queries"
- Success message when quality is high: "✅ Excellent curation: 6 videos added, 8.7 avg quality"

PART 3 - AUTOMATED BACKGROUND CRON JOB:

Implement server-side scheduled task:
1. Check if auto-curation toggle is ON
2. Check current time against configured schedule
3. If time matches, trigger curation automatically
4. Run curation based on saved settings (amount, frequency, aggressiveness)
5. Log results to activity table
6. Update dashboard stats in real-time
7. Send admin notification
8. Schedule next run

The admin NEVER needs to manually trigger this once it's configured and turned ON.

PART 4 - DOWNLOADABLE REPORTS:

"Full Report" button generates CSV/PDF with:
- All curation runs (date, time, results)
- Videos added per day/week/month
- Acceptance rate trends over time
- Quality distribution charts
- Instructor coverage (how many videos per instructor)
- Technique coverage (how many videos per technique)
- Recommended setting adjustments based on data

Make this a fully automated, set-it-and-forget-it system with complete visibility into performance.
