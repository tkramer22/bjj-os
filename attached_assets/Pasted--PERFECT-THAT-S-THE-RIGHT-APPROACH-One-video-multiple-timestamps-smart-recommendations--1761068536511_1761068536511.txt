🎯 CRITICAL: VIDEO TIMESTAMP REQUIREMENTS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION ON VIDEO TIMESTAMPING:

Each video can have MULTIPLE timestamps for different key points.

Example: "Triangle Choke System - John Danaher" (45 min video)

Timestamps stored in database:
{
  "introduction": 0,
  "concept_overview": 45,
  "setup_from_closed_guard": 120,
  "setup_from_mount": 180,
  "hand_positioning": 240,
  "angle_adjustment": 300,
  "finishing_mechanics": 360,
  "common_mistake_1_legs": 420,
  "common_mistake_2_angle": 480,
  "armbar_variation": 540,
  "omoplata_variation": 600,
  "troubleshooting_tight_neck": 720
}

SMART RECOMMENDATION LOGIC:

When user asks a question, Prof. OS should:

1. Find relevant videos
2. Match question to the MOST RELEVANT timestamp(s)
3. If ONE video has multiple relevant timestamps:
   - Recommend video ONCE with primary timestamp
   - Mention additional relevant sections

Example User Query: "How do I finish a triangle choke when their neck is too tight?"

Prof. OS Response:
"Here's how to finish a triangle with a tight neck:

[VIDEO CARD: Triangle Choke System - John Danaher]
▶️ Watch from 12:00 - Troubleshooting Tight Necks

This video also covers:
• 6:00 - Finishing Mechanics (fundamental technique)
• 4:00 - Angle Adjustment (helps when neck is tight)

Start with the 12:00 mark for your specific issue, then watch the other sections for context."

RULES:

✅ Each video appears ONCE per response (no duplicates)
✅ Primary timestamp = most relevant to user's question
✅ Secondary timestamps = mentioned as "also see" suggestions
✅ Max 2-3 videos per response (don't overwhelm user)
✅ Each video should have 5-15 timestamps (comprehensive coverage)

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

TIMESTAMP EXTRACTION REQUIREMENTS:

When analyzing videos with GPT-4o, extract DETAILED timestamps:

Prompt for GPT-4o:
"Analyze this BJJ instructional video and extract detailed timestamps.

Video: {title}
Description: {description}
Chapters: {chapters if available}

Extract timestamps for ALL distinct teaching points. Be thorough.

Categories to look for:
- Concept/Theory
- Setup/Entry (from different positions)
- Grips and Hand Positioning
- Key Details and Mechanics
- Execution/Finish
- Common Mistakes (each mistake separately)
- Variations (each variation separately)
- Troubleshooting specific issues
- Combinations/Chains

Return as JSON with descriptive keys:
{
  'introduction': 0,
  'setup_from_closed_guard': 120,
  'setup_from_mount': 180,
  'grip_details_right_hand': 240,
  'grip_details_left_hand': 270,
  'angle_adjustment_technique': 300,
  'finishing_mechanics': 360,
  'common_mistake_flat_angle': 420,
  'common_mistake_loose_triangle': 450,
  'armbar_variation': 540,
  'omoplata_variation': 600,
  'troubleshooting_tight_neck': 720,
  'troubleshooting_long_neck': 780
}

Use clear, searchable key names that describe the specific teaching point.
Each timestamp should be a distinct, valuable piece of instruction."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DATABASE SCHEMA FOR TIMESTAMPS:

videos table should have:
- id
- youtubeUrl
- title
- instructorName
- qualityScore
- timestamps (JSON) ← Store detailed timestamp object
- timestampCount (INTEGER) ← How many timestamps extracted
- createdAt

Example timestamps field value:
{
  "introduction": {
    "time": 0,
    "description": "Overview of triangle choke system",
    "keywords": ["overview", "introduction", "concept"]
  },
  "setup_from_closed_guard": {
    "time": 120,
    "description": "How to set up triangle from closed guard",
    "keywords": ["setup", "closed guard", "entry"]
  },
  "finishing_mechanics": {
    "time": 360,
    "description": "Proper mechanics to finish the triangle",
    "keywords": ["finish", "submission", "mechanics", "squeeze"]
  },
  "troubleshooting_tight_neck": {
    "time": 720,
    "description": "How to finish when opponent has tight neck",
    "keywords": ["troubleshooting", "tight neck", "problem solving"]
  }
}

This allows Prof. OS to:
- Search by keywords
- Match user intent to specific segments
- Rank relevance of different timestamps

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PROF. OS RECOMMENDATION LOGIC:

When responding to user query:

STEP 1: Understand user intent
- What technique? (triangle choke)
- What aspect? (finishing, setup, troubleshooting)
- What specific issue? (tight neck, escape prevention, etc)

STEP 2: Search videos
- Find videos about the technique
- Score relevance of each video
- Score relevance of each timestamp within videos

STEP 3: Rank timestamps across all videos
- Most relevant timestamp gets primary recommendation
- Group additional relevant timestamps by video

STEP 4: Format response
- Recommend top 2-3 videos (no duplicates)
- Each video shows once with primary timestamp
- List additional relevant timestamps as "Also see" suggestions
- Explain WHY each timestamp is relevant

Example Output Format:

"Here's how to finish a triangle when their neck is tight:

🎥 Triangle Choke System - John Danaher
▶️ Start at 12:00 - Troubleshooting Tight Necks
This segment specifically addresses your issue with tight necks and shows the angle adjustments needed.

Also in this video:
• 6:00 - Finishing Mechanics (understand the fundamental technique first)
• 4:00 - Angle Adjustment (critical for tight necks)

🎥 Triangle Details - Lachlan Giles  
▶️ Start at 8:30 - Neck Control Solutions
Lachlan covers a different approach using grip variations when the neck is tight.

🎥 No-Gi Triangle System - Gordon Ryan
▶️ Start at 15:45 - Tight Neck Workarounds
Gordon shows how to modify your triangle when you can't get deep on the neck."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DATA QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:

This timestamp data must be ROBUST and ACCURATE because it's the core value proposition.

VALIDATION CHECKS:

For each video after timestamp extraction:
✅ At least 5 timestamps extracted (if video >15 min)
✅ At least 10 timestamps extracted (if video >30 min)
✅ No duplicate timestamps (same time)
✅ Timestamps in chronological order
✅ Each timestamp has clear description
✅ Each timestamp has relevant keywords
✅ Timestamps cover all major teaching points in video

If video doesn't meet these criteria:
- Log warning: "Low timestamp quality for video {id}"
- Flag for manual review
- Still include video, but mark as "needs timestamp improvement"

IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY:

This timestamp system is CRITICAL to the product's value.

Without it: We're just another BJJ video aggregator
With it: We're the most intelligent BJJ learning system ever built

The difference between "Here are 5 triangle videos" (useless)
vs "Watch 4:32 of this video for your exact issue" (magical)

Build this system thoroughly and test it extensively.

# **THIS MAKES BJJ OS 100X BETTER THAN YOUTUBE:**

**YouTube:**

- Search “triangle choke”
- Get 10,000 videos
- Watch 45 minutes to find 30 seconds of what you need

**BJJ OS:**

- Ask “How do I finish a triangle when the neck is tight?”
- Get ONE video starting at 12:03
- See exact solution in 90 seconds

**That’s the magic.** ✨
