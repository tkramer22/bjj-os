# **ISSUE #7: META INSIGHTS DASHBOARD - UNCLEAR FUNCTIONALITY**

**Current Problems:**

1. **What does “Run Analysis” button actually DO?**
1. **How do I use this feature?**
1. **How does Prof. OS use this data?**
1. **How do we determine what’s “hot” or trending?**
1. **How are we tracking competition data?**

**Current State:**

- 8 Techniques Tracked
- 39 User Requests
- 0 Need Curation
- 260 Videos in Library
- “No trending techniques yet”

**Need clarity on:**

- Auto vs manual analysis
- Real-time tracking vs scheduled
- How it influences curation priorities
- How it feeds into Prof. OS recommendations
- What makes a technique “trending”

-----

## **FIX FOR ISSUE #7:**

Tell Replit Agent:

```
Build a comprehensive Meta Insights Dashboard that tracks trending techniques, user demand, and competition data to intelligently prioritize curation:

PART 1 - WHAT "RUN ANALYSIS" ACTUALLY DOES:

When admin clicks "Run Analysis", the system:

1. ANALYZES USER REQUESTS:
Scans all Prof. OS conversations from last 30 days:
- What techniques are users asking about?
- What problems are users trying to solve?
- What positions are users struggling with?
- What questions keep appearing repeatedly?

Examples:
- 12 users asked: "How do I pass half guard?"
- 8 users asked: "What do I do when I'm stuck in turtle?"
- 15 users asked: "How do I escape side control?"

Output: Ranked list of most-requested techniques

2. ANALYZES VIDEO LIBRARY GAPS:
Compares user requests against video library:
- Half guard passing: 12 requests, but only 3 videos → GAP
- Triangle choke: 5 requests, 18 videos → Well covered
- Turtle escapes: 8 requests, 2 videos → GAP

Output: Techniques that need more videos

3. TRACKS COMPETITION META:
Searches recent competition results:
- IBJJF World Championships (last 60 days)
- ADCC results (last 90 days)
- Pan Ams, Europeans, etc.

Looks for patterns:
- "Leg drag pass" won 15 matches at ADCC → Trending
- "Worm guard" appeared in 8 matches → Emerging
- "Berimbolo" only 2 matches → Declining

Output: Competition meta trends

4. MONITORS YOUTUBE TRENDS:
Checks what's trending in BJJ YouTube community:
- Which technique videos are getting most views?
- Which instructors are releasing new content?
- What's trending in BJJ subreddits?
- What techniques are people searching for?

Output: Social media trends

5. GENERATES CURATION PRIORITIES:
Combines all data to create action plan:
- Priority 1: Half guard passing (high demand, low supply)
- Priority 2: Turtle escapes (high demand, low supply)
- Priority 3: Leg drag pass (competition meta, moderate supply)
- Priority 4: Worm guard (emerging meta, low supply)

Output: Ranked list of techniques to curate next

6. AUTO-TRIGGERS TARGETED CURATION:
If "Auto-Curation" is enabled:
- Immediately searches YouTube for Priority 1 techniques
- Adds 5-10 videos for each gap
- Updates Meta dashboard with results

Result: Admin sees "Analysis complete: Added 23 videos for high-demand techniques"

PART 2 - DASHBOARD REDESIGN WITH CLEAR EXPLANATIONS:

Replace current confusing dashboard with this:

PART 3 - HOW PROF. OS USES META DATA:

1. PERSONALIZED RECOMMENDATIONS:
User: "What should I work on for my competition next month?"
Prof. OS checks Meta dashboard:
- Sees leg drag pass is trending at ADCC
- Sees user is brown belt (competition-level)
- Checks user's past sessions (already knows basic passing)

Prof. OS: "Based on current competition meta, the leg drag pass is winning 15+ matches at ADCC right now. Since you're competing next month, this is THE position to master. Here's a progression:

[VIDEO 1: Leg Drag Fundamentals - Lachlan Giles]
[VIDEO 2: Leg Drag to Back Take - Gordon Ryan]
[VIDEO 3: Competition Details - Craig Jones]

This technique is hot right now. Drill it daily."

2. GAP-DRIVEN SUGGESTIONS:
User: "I keep getting stuck in turtle"
Prof. OS checks Meta dashboard:
- Sees turtle escapes have 12 user requests
- Only 2 videos in library (gap identified)

Prof. OS: "Turtle escapes are surprisingly underrepresented in our library right now, but I've found the 2 best videos for you:

[VIDEO 1: Turtle Defense System - Priit Mihkelson]
[VIDEO 2: Granby Roll Escape - Marcelo Garcia]

Good news: We're adding more turtle content this week based on demand from users like you. Check back in a few days for more options."

Internal: Prof. OS flags this request → Meta dashboard updates → Auto-curation triggered

3. TRENDING ALERTS:
Prof. OS proactively suggests:
- "Hey, leg entanglements are trending at ADCC. Want to learn the modern game?"
- "12 other users are working on half guard passing right now. Join them?"
- "Competition season starting - here are the techniques winning gold this year"

4. PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATHS:
Meta data + user profile = smart recommendations:
- White belt asking about leg locks → Not recommended (unsafe for beginners)
- Brown belt asking about leg locks → Shows ADCC-trending content
- Blue belt struggling with guard retention → Shows fundamental techniques, not competition meta

PART 4 - AUTO VS MANUAL ANALYSIS:

Add settings panel:

PART 5 - WHAT MAKES A TECHNIQUE "TRENDING":

Clear algorithm explanation:

TRENDING SCORE CALCULATION:
1. User Request Volume (40% weight):
   - How many users asked about this technique in last 30 days?
   - Is this increasing vs last month?
   - High volume + high growth = trending

2. Video Library Gap (30% weight):
   - User requests vs videos available
   - 18 requests but only 4 videos = big gap = trending
   - 8 requests and 22 videos = no gap = not trending

3. Competition Meta (20% weight):
   - How many times did this technique win matches?
   - Is this increasing vs last competition season?
   - ADCC leg drags: 15 wins (up from 6) = trending

4. Social/YouTube Trends (10% weight):
   - Are popular BJJ channels teaching this?
   - Is this getting more views than usual?
   - Reddit/Instagram buzz?

FINAL TRENDING SCORE: 0-10
- 8.0-10.0: 🔥 HOT (urgent curation needed)
- 6.0-7.9: 📈 Trending (moderate priority)
- 4.0-5.9: Stable (normal coverage)
- 0-3.9: ❄️ Declining (low priority)

Example:
Half Guard Passing:
- User requests: 18 (↑200%) = 9.5/10
- Gap: 18 requests / 4 videos = 8.5/10
- Competition: Moderate use = 6.0/10
- Social: High search volume = 7.5/10
→ Final Score: 8.2/10 = 🔥 HOT
