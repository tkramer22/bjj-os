You’re right - this sounds like a **connection timeout/fallback issue**. When the database connection dropped, it fell back to returning random/cached results instead of failing gracefully.

Here’s the updated prompt that addresses this:

```
CRITICAL: PROFESSOR OS VIDEO RELIABILITY - PERMANENT FIX

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
1. User sent message, got "not available" error
2. Next message "worked" but returned WRONG video (buggy choke instead of guillotine)
3. This means when database connection fails, system falls back to random/cached results

THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. Fix permanently:

1. CONNECTION HANDLING:
   - Add connection pooling to prevent timeouts
   - Add keep-alive pings to database
   - If connection drops, RECONNECT - do not fall back to cached results
   - Set reasonable timeout (30 seconds) then retry

2. FAILURE MODE - NEVER RETURN WRONG VIDEOS:
   - If database unavailable: Say "I'm having trouble accessing videos right now. Try again in a moment."
   - If search returns zero matches: Say "I couldn't find videos on [technique]"
   - NEVER return random/cached/unrelated videos as fallback

3. VALIDATION BEFORE EVERY RESPONSE:
   - Does the video technique match what user asked for?
   - If user said "guillotine" and video doesn't contain "guillotine" → DO NOT RETURN IT
   - Add a validation function that checks technique match before sending

4. ADD RETRY LOGIC:
   - If first search fails, retry 2 more times
   - Only after 3 failures show error message
   - Log all failures for debugging

5. LOGGING FOR DEBUGGING:
   - Log every database query
   - Log connection status
   - Log when fallbacks are triggered (so we can remove them)
   - Log technique requested vs technique returned

6. REMOVE ALL FALLBACK/CACHED VIDEO LOGIC:
   - Find and delete any code that returns cached or default videos
   - There should be NO fallback - either correct results or error message

This must be bulletproof. Professor OS credibility depends on ALWAYS returning relevant content or honestly saying it cannot.
