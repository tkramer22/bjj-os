Walk me through the entire Training tab and Videos tab in the preview. Show me screenshots of each step. Do NOT publish.

TRAINING TAB WALKTHROUGH:

1. Show the Training tab main screen — I want to see:
- The header (should just say “Training”, no button top right)
- The streak line
- The calendar grid with today’s date styling (full solid fill, no rings/outlines)
- The recent sessions below (if any exist from our test)
- The Professor OS insight card at the bottom
1. Tap today’s date — show me the bottom sheet:
- Should say “How was training?” as the header
- 4 mood chips with emojis (🔥 Great, 👍 Good, 😤 Tough, 💀 Rough) on ONE row
- 4 session types (Class, Sparring, Open Mat, Comp) on ONE row, no labels above
- “What did you work on?” with technique chips
- Gi / No-Gi toggle
- “Add more ▾” expandable section
- Save button at bottom
1. Select “Great” mood — confirm it highlights PURPLE not green
1. Select “Class” session type — confirm it highlights PURPLE
1. Type “armbar” in technique search — confirm NO duplicate results
1. Tap “Add more ▾” — show me the expanded section with duration, rolls, subs, taps, notes
1. Save the session — show me:
- The purple dot appearing on the calendar (full solid fill)
- The streak updating
- The confirmation toast at the top
- The session card appearing in recent sessions
1. Tap the same date again — since there’s already a session,
   show me what happens (should allow adding another session)
1. Navigate to a previous month — swipe or tap the chevron,
   show me it works

VIDEOS TAB WALKTHROUGH:

1. Tap the Videos tab — show me the Library and Saved sub-tabs at the top
1. Tap “Saved” sub-tab — confirm my saved videos are all there and working
1. Tap “Library” sub-tab — confirm the taxonomy grid still works
1. Tap into a category and confirm videos load

FINAL CHECKS:

1. Tap Chat tab — send “what have I been training lately” to Professor OS
   Does it reference the training session I just logged?
1. Flip between all 4 tabs rapidly — does everything feel smooth
   and visually consistent?

Show me each step with screenshots before I approve for publishing.
