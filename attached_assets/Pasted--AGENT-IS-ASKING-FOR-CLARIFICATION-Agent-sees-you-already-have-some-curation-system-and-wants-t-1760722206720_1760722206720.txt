# 🎯 AGENT IS ASKING FOR CLARIFICATION

Agent sees you already have some curation system and wants to know what to do.

Option B - Check if curation is running properly and fix any issues

Here are the specific issues I'm experiencing:

1. CURATION NOT RUNNING:
   - Video library shows 0 videos
   - I have never received a single SMS notification
   - No evidence that any of the 5 daily curation runs have executed
   - The system appears completely dormant

2. DATABASE ERRORS:
   - Error: "relation bjj_users does not exist"
   - Cannot grant lifetime access from admin panel
   - Cannot add users manually
   - Admin functions completely broken

3. SMS NOTIFICATIONS MISSING:
   - Should receive daily summary at 9 AM EST to +19148373750
   - Have received zero texts since launch
   - Cannot verify if Twilio integration is working

WHAT I NEED YOU TO DO:

1. Verify the database tables actually exist (run migrations if needed)
2. Check if cron jobs are registered and running
3. Look at logs to see if curation has ever attempted to run
4. Fix any errors preventing curation from executing
5. Manually trigger ONE test curation run right now
6. Send me a test SMS to +19148373750 to prove it works
7. Ensure all 5 daily cron jobs are scheduled correctly (3am, 6am, 9am, 1pm, 5pm EST)
8. Fix the admin panel so I can grant lifetime access without errors

The app should be automatically curating BJJ videos 5 times daily and texting me once at 9 AM with a summary. None of this is happening.

Please diagnose what's broken and fix it so the system runs as designed.
