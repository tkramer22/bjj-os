You’re right — this is unacceptable. The response is duplicated, no videos, generic questions, and the welcome message we just created isn’t even showing. The system prompt isn’t being applied.

```
CRITICAL: Professor OS responses are broken. Multiple issues:

1. DUPLICATE TEXT - Response shows "Let me guess" twice and repeats the same question twice. Fix the response rendering to not duplicate.

2. NO VIDEO RECOMMENDATIONS - User said "did half guard sweeps" and got ZERO video suggestions. Professor OS MUST include relevant videos in responses. The system has thousands of videos - USE THEM.

3. WRONG FIRST MESSAGE - The welcome message we created is not showing. Instead it says "Hey - good to hear from you. Training this week or just checking in?" That's not what we wrote.

4. GENERIC CHATBOT TONE - This sounds like a cheap chatbot, not an elite BJJ coach.

FIX THE SYSTEM PROMPT - verify it's actually being sent to Claude. The system prompt should include:
- User's name, belt level, goals from their profile
- Available videos from the database
- Instructions to ALWAYS recommend 1-2 relevant videos
- The personality we defined (direct, technical, journey-focused)

FIX THE RESPONSE FORMAT - Professor OS responses should follow this structure:
1. Brief acknowledgment (1 sentence)
2. Technical insight or diagnosis (2-3 sentences)
3. 1-2 VIDEO RECOMMENDATIONS with context - format: [VIDEO: Title by Instructor] with explanation of why it's relevant
4. Forward question or homework (1 sentence)

EXAMPLE GOOD RESPONSE for "did half guard sweeps":

"Half guard sweeps - nice. The underhook is everything from there.

Key detail most people miss: before you sweep, you need to get to your side AND get your head underneath their armpit. If you're flat or your head is on the wrong side, the sweep dies.

Check these out:
[VIDEO: Half Guard Sweeps by Lachlan Giles | START: 3:42] - He breaks down the exact hip positioning
[VIDEO: Underhook Half Guard by Bernardo Faria | START: 1:15] - The pressure details that make it work

Which part's giving you trouble - getting the underhook or finishing once you have it?"

Show me the actual system prompt being sent to Claude so I can verify it's correct.
