URGENT: Run Aggressive Curation Immediately - Burn Remaining API Quota

CONTEXT:
YouTube API quota resets in 5 hours. We have remaining quota to use.
Let's run multiple curation cycles NOW to maximize video additions before reset.

TASK:

1. TRIGGER IMMEDIATE CURATION RUN
   Run the curation pipeline manually RIGHT NOW (don't wait for 2:40 AM):
   
   ```javascript
   // Trigger aggressive curation immediately
   await runAggressiveCuration();
```

1. RUN MULTIPLE BATCHES BACK-TO-BACK
   Since we have 5 hours until reset, run as many cycles as API quota allows:

- Check current quota usage first
- Calculate how many searches we can do (10,000 quota / 100 per search = 100 searches)
- Run multiple batches until quota exhausted or we hit diminishing returns
  
  Run 3-5 aggressive cycles back-to-back:
  
  ```javascript
  // Cycle 1
  await runAggressiveCuration();
  
  // Wait 2 minutes (let API calls complete)
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 120000));
  
  // Cycle 2
  await runAggressiveCuration();
  
  // Wait 2 minutes
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 120000));
  
  // Cycle 3
  await runAggressiveCuration();
  
  // Continue until quota exhausted
  ```

1. MONITOR REAL-TIME RESULTS
   After each cycle, show:

- Videos discovered
- Videos analyzed
- Videos approved/added
- Videos rejected
- API quota remaining
- Estimated videos until quota exhausted

1. MAXIMIZE ELITE INSTRUCTOR TARGETING
   Focus remaining quota on highest-value searches:

- JT Torres (20% of searches)
- Lachlan Giles, Danaher, Gordon Ryan (priority instructors)
- Techniques with lowest coverage first

1. STOP WHEN:

- API quota drops below 1,000 (save buffer for normal operations)
- OR we’ve added 100+ videos
- OR diminishing returns (approval rate drops below 40%)

EXPECTED OUTCOME:

- Use 8,000-9,000 quota units in next 2-3 hours
- Add 50-150 premium videos to library
- Bring total from 608 to 700-750 videos
- Start strong toward 3,000 video goal

Report back after each cycle with metrics.

START THE AGGRESSIVE RUN NOW.

## **🎯 WHAT THIS WILL DO**

### **Quota Math:**
- **Daily quota:** 10,000 units
- **Per search:** 100 units
- **Max searches today:** 100 total
- **Already used:** Probably <1,000 (system was broken)
- **Available NOW:** ~9,000 units = 90 searches

### **Expected Results (Next 2-3 Hours):**
- **Searches:** 80-90 (leaving 1,000 buffer)
- **Videos discovered:** 4,000-4,500 (50 per search)
- **Videos analyzed:** 800-900 (AI quality screening)
- **Videos approved:** 50-150 (60-70% approval with elite targeting)
- **Time required:** 2-3 hours (API rate limits + processing)

### **Conservative Estimate:**
- 80 searches × 50 results = 4,000 videos discovered
- 70% approval rate = **~80 new videos added tonight**
- Library: 608 → **~688 videos** by morning

### **Optimistic Estimate:**
- 90 searches × 50 results = 4,500 videos discovered
- 80% approval with elite targeting = **~120 new videos added**
- Library: 608 → **~728 videos** by morning

---

## **📊 MONITORING THE RUN**

Agent should report after each cycle:
```

CYCLE 1 COMPLETE:

- Searches executed: 30
- Videos discovered: 1,500
- Videos analyzed: 300
- Videos approved: 42
- Videos rejected: 8
- Approval rate: 84%
- API quota remaining: 7,000
- Library size: 650 videos

Continue to Cycle 2? YES

```
---

## **⏰ TIMELINE**

**Now (9:37 PM):** Start aggressive curation
**10:00 PM:** Cycle 1 complete (~20-30 videos added)
**10:30 PM:** Cycle 2 complete (~20-30 videos added)
**11:00 PM:** Cycle 3 complete (~20-30 videos added)
**11:30 PM:** Stop (quota buffer reached or diminishing returns)

**By midnight:** 50-100+ new premium videos in library

**Tomorrow 2:40 AM:** Fresh 10,000 quota, regular schedule resumes

---

## **🚨 SAFETY LIMITS**

Agent should stop if:
1. **Quota drops below 1,000** (need buffer for user operations)
2. **Approval rate drops below 40%** (quality degrading)
3. **Added 150 videos** (massive single-day win)
4. **Errors spike** (API rate limiting)

---

## **💡 WHY THIS IS SMART**

1. **Use it or lose it** - Quota resets at ~2:30 AM anyway
2. **Jump start library** - Get 10% closer to 3,000 goal tonight
3. **Validate system** - Prove curation actually works
4. **Elite content** - Targeting best instructors = high approval
5. **Fresh start tomorrow** - Full quota for regular operations

**Copy the prompt to Agent and watch the magic happen. You'll wake up to 50-150 new premium BJJ videos.** 🚀

Let Agent run wild for the next few hours. This is going to be awesome. 💪​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
