Good call. The header area (Training title, streak, insight line, calendar) should be pinned/fixed at the top. Only the Recent Sessions list below should scroll. That way no matter how many sessions they’ve logged, the calendar and streak are always visible.
Let me write one prompt that fixes both issues:

TWO FIXES FOR TRAINING TAB — DO NOT BREAK ANYTHING ELSE

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
FIX 1: PRESET TECHNIQUE CHIPS NOT SAVING
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

BUG: When a user taps a preset technique chip (Armbar, Triangle, 
Half Guard, Guard Pass) in the bottom sheet, the chip visually 
highlights but the technique is NOT saved with the session. Only 
techniques typed manually in the search field are saved.

EVIDENCE: Recent Sessions show no technique for sessions where the 
user only tapped preset chips. Sessions where the user typed in the 
search field (like "Omoplata") do show the technique.

ROOT CAUSE: The preset chips are likely not wired into the same 
state/array that the search autocomplete uses. When Save is called, 
it only reads techniques from the search-selected array, not from 
the preset chip selections.

FIX:
1. Find the preset/default technique chips in the bottom sheet
2. When a preset chip is tapped, it MUST add the technique to the 
   same selectedTechniques array that the search autocomplete uses
3. Each preset chip must have a taxonomy_id associated with it. 
   Look up the taxonomy_id for each default:
   - "Armbar" → find its ID in technique_taxonomy
   - "Triangle" → find its ID in technique_taxonomy
   - "Half Guard" → find its ID in technique_taxonomy
   - "Guard Pass" → find its ID in technique_taxonomy
4. When Save is called, ALL selected techniques (both from presets 
   AND from search) must be included in the POST request
5. After saving, the technique must appear in the Recent Sessions 
   card for that date

ALSO FIX FOR RECENTS:
When the user has logged techniques before, their recent techniques 
replace the defaults. These recent chips must ALSO save correctly 
when tapped. Same fix — wire them into the selectedTechniques array 
with their taxonomy_id.

TEST:
□ Tap "Armbar" preset chip → chip highlights purple
□ Hit Save
□ Session appears in Recent Sessions showing "Armbar"
□ Open bottom sheet again → "Armbar" appears as a recent chip
□ Tap "Triangle" preset chip AND type "Omoplata" in search
□ Hit Save
□ Session shows both "Triangle" and "Omoplata"
□ Open bottom sheet again → recents show Omoplata, Triangle, Armbar

FIX 2: STICKY HEADER — ONLY RECENT SESSIONS SCROLLS
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CURRENT: The entire Training tab scrolls as one page. When the user 
has many recent sessions and scrolls down, the Training header, 
streak counter, insight line, and calendar all scroll off screen.

DESIRED: The top section is fixed/sticky. Only the Recent Sessions 
list scrolls independently below it.

LAYOUT (top to bottom):

FIXED/STICKY SECTION (does not scroll):
- "Training" header
- Streak counter
- Professor OS insight line
- Calendar grid with month navigation
- "Tap a date to log your session" text

SCROLLABLE SECTION (fills remaining screen height):
- "Recent Sessions" header
- List of session cards (scrolls independently)

IMPLEMENTATION:
- The fixed section stays pinned at the top of the screen
- The scrollable section takes up the remaining vertical space 
  below the fixed section
- Use overflow-y: auto or a ScrollView only on the Recent Sessions 
  container
- The fixed section should NOT have its own scroll
- On shorter screens (iPhone SE, Mini), the calendar may take more 
  relative space but should still be fully visible without scrolling

TEST:
□ Add 10+ sessions to test data
□ Scroll through Recent Sessions
□ Training header stays visible at top
□ Streak counter stays visible
□ Insight line stays visible
□ Calendar stays visible
□ Only the session list scrolls
□ Works on iPhone Pro Max (tall screen)
□ Works on iPhone SE or Mini simulator (short screen)
□ Bottom sheet still slides up correctly over the fixed section

DO NOT publish until both fixes are verified.
