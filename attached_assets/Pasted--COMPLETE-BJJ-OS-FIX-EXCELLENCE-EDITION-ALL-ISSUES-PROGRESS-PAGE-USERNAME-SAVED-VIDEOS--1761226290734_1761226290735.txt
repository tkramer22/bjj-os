COMPLETE BJJ OS FIX - EXCELLENCE EDITION - ALL ISSUES + PROGRESS PAGE + USERNAME + SAVED VIDEOS + PERFECT BELT GRAPHICS

DESIGN PHILOSOPHY:
Excellence is our pillar. Every pixel matters. This is a premium product that must look and feel world-class. No shortcuts, no compromises.

CRITICAL BUGS TO FIX:

ISSUE 1: ONBOARDING BYPASS FOR EXISTING USERS
Problem: Users who already completed onboarding are forced through it again on subsequent logins.

Fix Required:
- Check if user has completed onboarding (belt_level EXISTS in database)
- If onboarding complete, redirect directly to /chat (NOT /welcome)
- Onboarding should only show ONCE per user, ever
- Lifetime users treated EXACTLY like paying users after initial setup (no feature differences)

Correct Authentication Flow:
1. User enters phone number
2. Check database: Does this phone number have a profile?
   - YES → User logs in → Redirect to /chat (all previous data loads automatically)
   - NO → New user → Complete onboarding → Save profile → Redirect to /chat
3. User stays logged in across all pages
4. No forced logout unless user clicks logout or session expires (30 days)
5. Previous chats, saved videos, settings ALL persist and load when user returns

ISSUE 2: CHAT ERROR - "Failed to send message. Please try again."
Problem: Chat interface shows red error when trying to send messages.

Debug and fix:
- Check API endpoint connection to backend (https://twilio-daily-sms-toddkramer2.replit.app)
- Verify Claude API key is active and working
- Check authentication token is being passed correctly in API calls
- Verify user session is maintained
- Check console for specific error message and fix root cause
- Test message sending end-to-end

This is CRITICAL - chat must work or app is useless.

ISSUE 3: NAVIGATION ERRORS
Problem: Clicking "Home" from Progress page redirects to landing page, then forces login again.

Fix Required:
- "Home" button should go to /chat (NOT / landing page)
- User session should persist across ALL pages
- No forced re-login unless session actually expired
- Remove landing page redirect for logged-in users
- If user is authenticated, never show landing page

ISSUE 4: CHAT TIMESTAMPS
Problem: Need better timestamp formatting.

Fix Required:
- Show time for messages within last 24 hours: "9:45 AM"
- Show date + time for messages older than 24 hours: "Oct 22, 9:45 AM"
- Group messages by date with date dividers: "Today", "Yesterday", "Oct 20"

ISSUE 5: SESSION PERSISTENCE
Problem: User session not persisting correctly, causing forced re-logins.

Fix Required:
- Implement proper session management (JWT or session cookies)
- Session should last 30 days minimum
- Store session in localStorage as backup
- Check authentication on route change, not page refresh
- Session should work across all pages
- When user returns (even weeks later), everything loads: chat history, saved videos, settings

BELT GRAPHIC REDESIGN - PERFECTION REQUIRED:

This is CRITICAL for brand identity. The belt must look exactly like a real IBJJF belt.

BELT PROGRESSION (5 RANKS):

1. WHITE BELT
   - Main section: White #FFFFFF (90% of belt width)
   - Stripe section: White #FFFFFF (10% of belt width)
   - Stripes: None visible (white on white)
   - Border: 2px solid #333333 around entire belt (so it shows on dark background)

2. BLUE BELT (DEFAULT FOR LANDING PAGE)
   - Main section: IBJJF Blue #2563EB (90% of belt width)
   - Stripe section: Black #000000 (10% of belt width)
   - Stripes: 4 white vertical stripes
   - Black section border: 2px white #FFFFFF (so black stands out)

3. PURPLE BELT
   - Main section: IBJJF Purple #7C3AED (90% of belt width)
   - Stripe section: Black #000000 (10% of belt width)
   - Stripes: 4 white vertical stripes
   - Black section border: 2px white #FFFFFF

4. BROWN BELT
   - Main section: IBJJF Brown #92400E (90% of belt width)
   - Stripe section: Black #000000 (10% of belt width)
   - Stripes: 4 white vertical stripes
   - Black section border: 2px white #FFFFFF

5. BLACK BELT

   - Stripe section: Red #DC2626 (10% of belt width)
   - Stripes: 4 white vertical stripes
   - Main section border: 2px white #FFFFFF (so black shows on dark background)

BELT SPECIFICATIONS (ALL RANKS):

Dimensions:
- Width: 500px total
- Height: 80px
- Perfectly straight horizontal rectangle (no curves, no angles)

Main Section (Left side):
- 90% of total width (~450px)
- Solid color based on belt rank
- No gradients, no patterns, flat color

Stripe Section (Right side):
- Only 10% of total width (~50px) - THIS IS SMALL, just the tip of the belt
- Black for White/Blue/Purple/Brown belts
- Red for Black belt only
- This is where the 4 stripes go

Stripes (only on stripe section):
- 4 white vertical stripes
- Style: Must look like white athletic tape wrapped around a real belt
- Each stripe: 4px wide × 60px tall (leaves 10px margin top/bottom)
- Evenly spaced across the 50px stripe section with equal gaps
- Color: White #FFFFFF
- Add subtle texture/shadow to make them look like real tape (not flat rectangles)
- Think: actual white tape wrapped around dark fabric

Visual Quality:
- Clean, crisp edges
- Subtle drop shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4)
- Professional SVG quality, not pixelated
- Should look premium and authentic

Belt Display Logic:
- Landing page (not logged in): Show BLUE BELT
- Onboarding Step 3 (belt selection): Show belt being selected
- Dashboard/Chat (logged in): Show user's current belt rank
- Progress page: Show user's belt rank at top
- Settings page: Show user's belt rank

The belt is a core brand element. It must be perfect. No compromises.

- Dropdown default: "All Categories"
- Options:
  - All Categories
  - Submissions
  - Guard Passes

  - All Instructors
  - [Alphabetically sorted list of unique instructors from user's saved videos]
  - Example: Bernardo Faria, Gordon Ryan, John Danaher, Lachlan Giles, etc.
- Style: Same as category dropdown

Filter Behavior:
- Both filters work together (AND logic)
- Real-time filtering (no apply button needed)
- Examples:
  - "Submissions" + "John Danaher" → only Danaher submission videos
  - "All Categories" + "Gordon Ryan" → all Gordon Ryan videos
  - "Guard Passes" + "All Instructors" → all guard pass videos

Video Grid Display:

  - Rounded 12px

Auto-Categorization Logic:
- When user saves a video from chat, AI automatically assigns category
- Extract category from video title, description, or conversation context
- Extract instructor name and standardize (John Danaher → Danaher, Gordon Ryan → Gordon Ryan)
- If uncertain, default to "Other" category

Database for Saved Videos:
- Table: saved_videos
  - id (UUID, primary key)
  - user_id (UUID, foreign key → users.id)
  - video_url (STRING, not null)
  - video_title (STRING, not null)
  - instructor_name (STRING, not null) - standardized format
  - category (STRING, not null) - must be one of the 8 categories
  - thumbnail_url (STRING, nullable)
  - saved_at (TIMESTAMP, default now())
  - notes (TEXT, nullable) - user can add personal notes later

When user saves a video in chat:
1. AI extracts: title, instructor, category, URL
2. Save to saved_videos table
3. Show success toast: "Saved to [Category] - [Instructor]" (green, 3 seconds)
4. Video immediately appears in Saved Videos page

NEW FEATURE: PROGRESS PAGE

- Centered on page
- 40px vertical spacing between cards
- Mobile: 20px side margins, full width minus margins

Streak Calculation Logic (implement in backend):
- On each login, check last_login_date
- If last login was yesterday: current_streak++
- If last login was today (same day): no change to streak
- If last login was 2+ days ago: current_streak = 1 (reset)
- Update last_login_date to today
- Increment total_logins by 1

USER EXPERIENCE - LIFETIME VS PAID:

Lifetime users = Paid users (NO DIFFERENCES)
- Both get: full chat, video recommendations, saved videos, progress tracking, ALL features
- Database field subscription_tier = "lifetime" or "paid"
- UI never shows subscription tier to user
- No feature gates, no upsells, no limitations

Returning User Flow (SEAMLESS):
1. User enters phone number
2. System checks: phone number exists in database?
3. YES → Log in automatically
4. Load ALL user data:
   - Chat history (all previous conversations)
   - Saved videos (with categories and instructors)
   - Settings (belt, preferences, optional info)
   - Progress stats (streak, logins, member since)
5. Redirect to /chat
6. User sees "Welcome back, [username]" from Prof. OS
7. Everything works as if they never left

New User Flow:
1. Enter phone number → verify SMS code
2. Complete 4-step onboarding (username → belt → preferences)
3. Save all data to database, set onboarding_completed = true
4. Redirect to /chat
5. Prof. OS sends welcome message personalized to their belt level

PRIORITY ORDER (IMPLEMENT IN THIS SEQUENCE):

1. FIX CHAT ERROR - Debug and fix message sending (BLOCKING ISSUE)
2. FIX SESSION PERSISTENCE - User stays logged in, data loads on return
3. FIX ONBOARDING BYPASS - Check onboarding_completed, skip if true
4. PERFECT BELT GRAPHICS - All 5 belts with exact specifications
