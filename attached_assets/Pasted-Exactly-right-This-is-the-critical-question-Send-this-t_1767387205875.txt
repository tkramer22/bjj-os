CONFIRM: GEMINI ANALYSIS IS THE FOUNDATION OF PROFESSOR OS

I need to verify that Professor OS uses Gemini-analyzed data as its PRIMARY 
knowledge source when answering questions - not just for video search, but 
for ALL technique knowledge.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
QUESTION 1: WHAT DOES PROFESSOR OS "SEE"?
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

When a user asks "How do I finish a guillotine?", what data is injected into 
Claude's system prompt?

Show me the EXACT data that gets passed to buildSystemPrompt() for this query.

Does it include:
- Gemini's key_concepts for guillotine videos?
- Gemini's instructor_tips?
- Gemini's common_mistakes?
- Gemini's timestamps showing WHEN in the video the finish is taught?
- Gemini's setup_from and chains_to data?

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
QUESTION 2: KNOWLEDGE VS SEARCH
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

There's a difference between:
A) VIDEO SEARCH - Finding relevant videos to recommend
B) KNOWLEDGE INJECTION - Professor OS knowing technique details

Both should use Gemini data. Confirm:

A) When searching for videos → Uses Gemini fields ✓ (just fixed)
B) When answering technique questions → Does this ALSO use Gemini fields?

If user asks "What are common guillotine mistakes?" - Professor OS should 
pull from the common_mistakes field of guillotine-related videos, NOT from 
Claude's general training knowledge.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
QUESTION 3: SHOW ME THE PROMPT STRUCTURE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Show me what buildSystemPrompt() actually injects. Does it include sections like:

"Here is detailed technique knowledge from analyzed instructional videos:

GUILLOTINE FINISHING DETAILS (from John Danaher - Front Headlock System):
- Key concepts: [Gemini extracted data]
- Instructor tips: [Gemini extracted data]  
- Common mistakes: [Gemini extracted data]
- Timestamps: 4:32 - grip mechanics, 7:15 - head position..."

Or is it just:
"Available videos: Danaher Guillotine, Gordon Ryan Guillotine..."

The first approach = Professor OS has DEEP KNOWLEDGE
The second approach = Professor OS is just a video search engine

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
WHAT I NEED
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Confirm that when Professor OS answers ANY technique question:
1. It queries Gemini-analyzed fields for relevant videos
2. It injects the FULL Gemini analysis (not just titles) into Claude's context
3. Claude uses this injected knowledge to answer with SPECIFIC details
4. The answer reflects what instructors ACTUALLY teach, not generic BJJ knowledge

This is our moat. Professor OS should know "Danaher says the key to guillotine 
finish is head position at the 7:15 mark" - because Gemini extracted that.

Show me the architecture that makes this happen.
