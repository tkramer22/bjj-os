```
You are a senior full-stack developer expert in React Native, Expo, Express.js, PostgreSQL, and mobile app development. I need you to help me get BJJ OS - a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu coaching app - running on iOS.

# CURRENT SITUATION

I have been working on getting the iOS version of BJJ OS to run in the simulator. The project has:
- React Native 0.81.5 with Expo SDK 54
- Backend API running at bjjos.app (Replit)
- PostgreSQL database (Supabase)
- Phone-based SMS authentication (Twilio)
- Claude API integration for AI coaching

The iOS build keeps failing with various dependency conflicts, corrupted Podfiles, and Metro bundler errors.

# WHAT I NEED

I need you to:

1. **Audit the entire project structure** and identify configuration issues
2. **Check if the iOS folder is salvageable** or if it needs to be regenerated
3. **Verify the backend API is working** and accessible at bjjos.app
4. **Fix any broken dependencies** in package.json
5. **Get the app running in iOS Simulator** with these requirements:
   - Load JavaScript from bundled code (NOT Metro dev server)
   - Connect to bjjos.app backend
   - Test login flow with phone number: (914) 837-3750
   - Verify Prof. OS chat interface works

# PROJECT CONTEXT

- This is a premium BJJ coaching app ($14.99/month subscription)
- Target users: serious BJJ practitioners training 6x weekly
- Core feature: Prof. OS - AI coach powered by Claude API
- Backend handles: authentication, user management, conversation history, video curation
- Mobile app needs: native iOS experience, voice input/output, offline capability

# SPECIFIC FILES TO CHECK

Please examine:
- `/ios/BJJOS.xcworkspace` - Xcode project
- `/ios/Podfile` - CocoaPods configuration
- `/ios/BJJOS/AppDelegate.mm` - App entry point and JS bundle loading
- `/package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- `/app.json` - Expo configuration
- `/index.js` or `/App.tsx` - JavaScript entry point

# DEBUGGING APPROACH

1. Start by showing me the current state of these key files
2. Identify the root cause of build failures
3. Provide a step-by-step fix with exact commands to run
4. If the iOS folder is too corrupted, guide me through either:
   - Regenerating it with `npx expo prebuild --clean`
   - OR creating a fresh Expo project and migrating code

# TESTING REQUIREMENTS

Once built, the app must:
- Launch in iOS Simulator without crashing
- Display the login screen
- Accept phone number input
- Send SMS verification via Twilio
- Connect to bjjos.app API endpoints
- Show Prof. OS chat interface after login

# IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS

- Excellence is the pillar - premium quality only
- Must use standalone build (no Expo Go, no Metro dev server)
- App Store submission ready
- Native iOS performance

Please start by auditing the project and telling me what's broken and how to fix it.
