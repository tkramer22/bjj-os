These are critical questions. Let me get clarity before we proceed.

**Here’s the diagnostic prompt:**

CLARIFY TWO CRITICAL SYSTEMS BEFORE WE PROCEED

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
QUESTION 1: VIDEO CURATION STATUS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The YouTube quota shows 0/10,000 used - meaning curation is NOT running.

Answer these:

1. Is the curation pipeline currently RUNNING or STOPPED?
2. If stopped, why? Show the error logs.
3. Is there a scheduled job/cron that runs curation automatically?
4. If not, how do we set one up to run daily and max out the 10,000 quota?
5. Run a curation cycle NOW and show me live progress.

Goal: Curation should run automatically every day until quota is exhausted.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
QUESTION 2: USER MEMORY ARCHITECTURE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Explain EXACTLY how user memory works:

A. USER PROFILE (Permanent)
- Does each user have a permanent profile stored in the database?
- What fields are stored? (belt, weight, goals, training frequency, etc.)
- Does this persist forever?
- Show me the schema.

B. CONVERSATION HISTORY
- You said "20 messages" - does that mean we only load the LAST 20?
- What happens to older messages? Are they deleted or just not loaded?
- Is the FULL history stored in the database permanently?
- If a user has 500 messages over 6 months, what can Professor OS access?

C. MEMORY MARKERS / PATTERNS
- Are significant moments (breakthroughs, struggles) stored permanently?
- Is this separate from the 20-message limit?
- Show me what gets stored in user_memory_markers and detected_patterns tables.

D. LEARNING OVER TIME
- Does each user's profile get SMARTER over time?
- Are patterns automatically detected and stored?
- Give me an example of how a 6-month user's context differs from a new user.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
QUESTION 3: POPULATION INTELLIGENCE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

We seeded population_intelligence with 10 techniques. But:

1. Is this table STATIC (just seed data) or does it LEARN from user interactions?
2. If a user reports "I finally hit the triangle after 30 days of drilling" - does that update the population data?
3. How does the system aggregate learnings across users?
4. Show me the code that updates population_intelligence based on user feedback.
5. If there's no learning mechanism, we need to build one.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
DELIVERABLE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Provide a clear answer for each question above.

Then give me a summary:

CURATION:
- Status: RUNNING / STOPPED
- Auto-scheduled: YES / NO
- Fix needed: [what]

USER MEMORY:
- Permanent profile: YES / NO
- Full history stored: YES / NO  
- Only last 20 loaded into context: YES / NO
- Patterns detected automatically: YES / NO

POPULATION INTELLIGENCE:
- Currently learning from users: YES / NO
- Static seed data only: YES / NO
- Learning mechanism exists: YES / NO
```

**This will tell us exactly what’s working vs what’s just designed but not connected.**
