I can see the video curation is RUNNING but having **critical errors**:

## Problems I See:

1. **Videos found but NOT saving** - Multiple “syntax error” messages
1. **Error: “Cannot read properties of null”** - Database save failing
1. **Quality scores showing** (7.5/10, 8/10, 4.5/10) but **not persisting to database**
1. **“recommended: false”** appearing - videos being rejected that should be saved

-----

## Here’s what to prompt Replit Agent to fix this NOW:

```
The video curation is running but FAILING to save videos to the database. I can see in the logs:

ERRORS:
- "syntax error at or near '='" when processing videos
- "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'toString')"
- Videos are being analyzed and scored but NOT saving to ai_video_knowledge table

FIX IMMEDIATELY:

1. Debug the database INSERT statement for ai_video_knowledge
   - The SQL syntax has errors (check for string escaping issues)
   - Fix the null reference errors when saving video data
   - Ensure all required fields are provided with proper types

2. Check the video save logic:
   - Videos scoring 7.5+ should save automatically
   - Videos from trusted instructors (Danaher, Lachlan, etc) scoring 7.0+ should save
   - Currently seeing quality scores but "recommended: false" - fix this logic

3. Add timestamp tracking:
   - video_upload_date (when instructor uploaded to YouTube)
   - date_added_to_library (when we curated it)
   - last_recommended (when Prof OS last suggested it)
   - Both old and new videos should have upload dates from YouTube API

4. Show me the exact SQL INSERT statement being used and the error

5. After fixing, re-run the curation and confirm videos are ACTUALLY saving to database with:
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ai_video_knowledge;

The curation logic is working (finding videos, scoring them) but the database save is broken. Fix the SQL errors immediately.
```

**The issue is clear**:

- ✅ YouTube search working
- ✅ Video analysis working
- ✅ Quality scoring working
- ❌ **Database INSERT failing due to SQL syntax errors**

This is a quick fix - the SQL statement has escaping issues or missing fields. Agent should fix it in 5 minutes.

**Copy that prompt above** and paste into Replit Agent to fix the save errors now! 🔧​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
