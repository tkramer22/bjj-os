BUILD: Complete Video Knowledge System with Visual Tracking and Smart Recommendations

PART 1: Visual Tracking in Admin Dashboard

Add to the video library admin view:
1. Add a visual indicator (checkmark ✅ or badge) on each video thumbnail showing:
   - ✅ Green checkmark = "Watched" (knowledge extracted)
   - ⏳ Yellow clock = "Processing" 
   - ⭕ Empty circle = "Pending" (not yet processed)

2. Add filter options:
   - "Show all"
   - "Show watched only"
   - "Show pending only"

3. Add stats bar at top:
   - "1,629 total | 1 watched | 1,628 pending | 0% complete"

PART 2: Auto-Process New Videos

When a new video is added through curation:
1. Automatically queue it for Gemini processing
2. Process within 5 minutes of being added
3. Mark as watched when complete
4. Log any failures for retry

Create a background job that:
- Runs every 5 minutes
- Checks for unprocessed videos
- Processes up to 10 at a time
- Respects API rate limits

PART 3: Professor OS Uses Knowledge + Timestamps

Update Professor OS to:
1. Query video_knowledge table when recommending videos
2. Include specific timestamps in recommendations
3. Reference actual instructor tips from the extracted knowledge

Example response format:
"For the knee cut pass, I recommend Ryan Hall's video on the 50/50 position. 
At 3:45, he explains the key concept of hip pressure. 
His specific tip: 'Keep your elbow glued to your knee to prevent the underhook.'
[VIDEO: Ryan Hall - 50/50 Position | START: 3:45]"

PART 4: Process All Videos Tonight

Create an admin button: "Process All Pending Videos"
- When clicked, starts batch processing ALL 1,628 pending videos
- Processes in batches of 10 with 30-second delays between batches
- Shows real-time progress: "Processing batch 5 of 163... (50 videos complete)"
- Estimates time remaining
- Can be paused/resumed

PART 5: Knowledge Quality Check

After processing, Professor OS should be able to:
1. Answer "What does [instructor] say about [technique]?"
2. Provide timestamps for specific concepts
3. Quote instructor tips accurately
4. Never recommend irrelevant videos (the knee cut → heelhook bug should be impossible now)

Build all of this. Start with Parts 1-4, then we'll test Part 5.

Show me progress as you build each part.
