CRITICAL: Admin video library page is now completely blank. Fix it properly with this exact specification.

STEP 1: ROLLBACK AND RESTORE
The page at /admin/videos is blank. First restore basic functionality - get the page rendering again.

STEP 2: FIX THE VIDEO LIST QUERY
The stats endpoint works (shows 800 videos, 212 instructors). The video list endpoint returns nothing.

Find why the stats query works but the video list query doesn't. They should query the same table (ai_video_knowledge). Fix the video list query to return actual videos.

STEP 3: BUILD THE CORRECT UI

LAYOUT (top to bottom):
1. Page title: "Video Library"
2. Stats cards row: Total Videos | Instructors | Techniques | Avg Quality (keep existing - this works)
3. Filters row:
   - Search bar (searches title AND instructor name)
   - Instructor dropdown (populated from database, shows all unique instructors)
   - Technique dropdown (populated from database, shows all unique techniques)
4. Video grid:
   - Thumbnail (use YouTube thumbnail: https://img.youtube.com/vi/[VIDEO_ID]/mqdefault.jpg)
   - Video title
   - Instructor name
   - Technique category
   - Quality score

FILTER BEHAVIOR:
- Show ALL videos by default (no minimum quality filter)
- Search bar filters as user types
- Dropdowns filter immediately on selection
- Filters work together (AND logic)

DROPDOWN DATA:
- Instructor dropdown: SELECT DISTINCT instructor_name FROM ai_video_knowledge ORDER BY instructor_name
- Technique dropdown: SELECT DISTINCT technique_category FROM ai_video_knowledge ORDER BY technique_category

VIDEO LIST QUERY:
SELECT id, title, youtube_url, instructor_name, technique_category, quality_score 
FROM ai_video_knowledge 
ORDER BY quality_score DESC
LIMIT 50

Extract VIDEO_ID from youtube_url for thumbnails.

TEST BEFORE PUBLISHING:
1. Page loads without blank screen
2. Stats cards show correct numbers
3. Both dropdowns populate with options
4. Video grid shows thumbnails
5. Search filters videos
6. Dropdown filters work
