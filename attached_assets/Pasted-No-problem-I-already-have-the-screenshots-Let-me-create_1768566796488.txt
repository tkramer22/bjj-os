No problem! I already have the screenshots. Let me create the comprehensive prompt now based on everything we’ve discussed:

COMPREHENSIVE FIX: Admin Dashboard, Curation Metrics, Emails, and New Feature

====== ISSUE 1: Admin Dashboard Fixes ======

Command Center shows all zeros (0/0/0/0) but Videos page shows real data (653/58/58/595)
- Fix Command Center to pull from correct data source (production Supabase)

User Activity (24h) fails to load
- Error: column "user_question" does not exist
- Find and use the correct column name

Meta Insights Dashboard not interactive
- "Techniques Tracked: 35" should be clickable to show the list
- "User Requests (7d): 3" should be clickable to show what users asked
- "Need Curation: 32" should show what needs curation
- Bottom tabs (Trending Techniques, Curation Priorities, User Requests, Unmet Requests) show empty/no data - populate them

Execution Log time format
- Currently shows "71 ms" - not useful
- Change to: "X hours ago" for recent runs
- Change to: "X days ago" when over 24 hours

====== ISSUE 2: Curation Metric Discrepancy ======

- Dashboard shows "Curation Runs Today: 0" but startup check says "3 curation runs completed today"
- The metrics collection query isn't counting runs correctly
- Fix so the displayed number matches actual completed runs

====== ISSUE 3: Stale Alert ======

- "Curation Pipeline Offline" alert is flagged but curation IS working (75 videos added today)
- This is a false positive / stale alert
- Fix the alert logic so it clears when curation is actually running
- Alert should only show if NO videos have been added in 24+ hours

====== ISSUE 4: Server Restart Emails ======

- Server restarted 6 times between 3:25 AM and 6:47 AM - too many emails
- Change to: Only send ONE restart email per 24-hour period
- OR: Only send if server was down for more than 5 minutes
- Keep curation completion emails (like "Curation Complete: +22 videos")
- Add "restart_email_sent_at" timestamp to prevent spam

====== ISSUE 5: Manual Curation Throttling ======

- Confirm that manually running curation (by instructor, technique, position, meta) does NOT interfere with scheduled auto-curation
- The 4x daily auto-curation (3:15am, 9am, 3pm, 9pm EST) should NEVER be throttled or skipped because of a manual run
- Document how this works

====== NEW FEATURE: "Recently Added" in Video Library ======

Add "Recently Added" as the first option in the Technique list in Video Library
- Display "100" as the count next to it
- When selected, return the 100 most recently added videos (ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 100)
- Must appear BEFORE alphabetized techniques (not alphabetized with them)
- Newest video appears first in the list
- This is API-only change - no frontend rebuild needed
- Updates automatically as curation adds new videos

====== SUMMARY ======

Fix all dashboard display issues, metric counting, stale alerts, email spam, and add the Recently Added feature. All data exists in production Supabase - the dashboard just needs to display it correctly.
