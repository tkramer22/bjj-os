## IF ANY SECTIONS ARE MISSING:

Build them now. The complete page component code is:

```tsx
// Paste the full CurationCommandCenter component if missing sections
```

## TEST THE FUNCTIONALITY:

1. Click the Auto Curation toggle - should switch between ACTIVE/PAUSED
1. Enter “guillotine” in Technique search and click Run Now - should start a job
1. Job should appear in Active Jobs section
1. When complete, should appear in Recent History

Confirm all 6 sections are present and the toggle + all 6 curation preset buttons work.
