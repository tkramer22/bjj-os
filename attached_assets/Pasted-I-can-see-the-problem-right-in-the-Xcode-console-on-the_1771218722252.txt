I can see the problem right in the Xcode console on the right:
“TO JS undefined” — twice. And “To Native → Haptics notification 93916876” in between.
Exactly what I suspected. The haptic call on delete is throwing a JS undefined error which is killing the delete function before it reaches the API call. The haptic fires, throws an error, and the delete never executes.

CRITICAL FIX — DELETE BROKEN BY HAPTICS

The delete button is not working. The Xcode console shows 
"TO JS undefined" errors when tapping Delete.

The haptic notification call on delete is throwing an error 
that prevents the delete API call from executing.

FIX IMMEDIATELY:

1. Find the delete session handler in the Training tab code

2. The haptic call is BLOCKING the delete. Either:
   a) The haptic is awaited and throws before the delete runs
   b) The haptic and delete are in the same try/catch and the 
      haptic error catches and skips the delete

3. Move the haptic AFTER the delete, or remove it entirely 
   from delete. The delete operation is more important than 
   a vibration.

4. Create this wrapper function if it doesn't exist yet:

   const safeHaptic = async (style) => {
     try { await Haptics.impact({ style }); } catch (e) {}
   };

   const safeNotification = async (type) => {
     try { await Haptics.notification({ type }); } catch (e) {}
   };

5. Replace EVERY direct Haptics call in the Training tab with 
   the safe wrapper. Every single one. Search for "Haptics." 
   and replace all instances.

6. For the delete handler specifically, the order must be:
   a) Call DELETE /api/training/sessions/:id
   b) Wait for success response
   c) Close the bottom sheet
   d) Refresh calendar and recent sessions
   e) THEN try haptic (optional, non-blocking)

7. Same fix for Update — make sure haptics don't block the 
   PUT request either.

TEST:
□ Tap Delete → session deletes, bottom sheet closes
□ Tap Update → session updates, bottom sheet closes
□ No "TO JS undefined" errors in Xcode console
□ Calendar and recent sessions refresh after delete/update
□ Haptics still work on other interactions (non-blocking)

THIS IS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY FIX. Ship nothing else until 
delete and update work again.
