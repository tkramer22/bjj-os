**You’re right!** Let me search the project files to see what we designed for video curation controls.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

Let me search for more specific information about the curation toggle and admin controls:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**YOU’RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT!** Looking at the checkpoint file - **PROMPT 6.5 was supposed to include an Admin Video Dashboard with curation controls**, but it hasn’t been built yet!

Here’s what was planned:

-----

## **PROMPT 6.5: ADMIN VIDEO DASHBOARD (NOT BUILT YET)**

**Features that should exist:**

```
Admin Video Dashboard:

📊 STATS CARDS:
- Total videos: 260
- Avg quality: 8/10
- Helpful ratio: (not tracking yet)

🎛️ CURATION CONTROLS:
- Toggle: Automatic Curation ON/OFF
- Manual review mode toggle
- Quality threshold slider (7.0-9.0)
- Run curation now button

📅 RECENTLY ADDED:
- Last 24 hours: 2 videos
- This week
- This month

📋 ALL VIDEOS TABLE:
- Search/filter
- Sort by quality, date, technique
- Remove video option
- Manual approve/reject
```

-----

## **WHAT’S MISSING:**

Looking at your screenshot, the current admin dashboard only shows:

- ✅ Video library (260 videos, 8/10 quality, 2 added today)
- ✅ Search and filter
- ✅ Watch video / Full video buttons
- ❌ **NO curation toggle controls**
- ❌ **NO auto-review on/off switch**
- ❌ **NO manual curation controls**

-----

## **SEND THIS TO REPLIT AGENT:**

```
ADD: Curation control panel to Admin Video Dashboard

CURRENT STATE:
The admin video dashboard at /admin/videos shows the video library but is missing curation controls.

REQUIRED ADDITIONS:

1. ADD CURATION CONTROLS PANEL (above video library)

```

1. TOGGLE BEHAVIORS:

AUTOMATIC CURATION:

- ON: System runs daily, auto-adds videos scoring above threshold
- OFF: System still analyzes but doesn’t add anything automatically

MANUAL REVIEW MODE:

- ON: All videos go to review queue, admin must approve
- OFF: Videos scoring above threshold auto-add to library

QUALITY THRESHOLD SLIDER:

- Range: 6.0 to 9.0
- Default: 7.5
- Updates in real-time
- Shows: “Threshold: 7.5/10”

RUN CURATION NOW BUTTON:

- Manually triggers curation process
- Shows loading state: “Running curation…”
- After complete: “Added X videos, rejected Y videos”

REVIEW QUEUE BUTTON:

- Shows count of videos pending review
- Opens modal with pending videos
- Each video shows: Title, instructor, quality score, approve/reject buttons

1. DATABASE CHANGES:

Add curation_settings table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE curation_settings (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  automatic_curation_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  manual_review_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  quality_threshold DECIMAL DEFAULT 7.5,
  last_run_at TIMESTAMP,
  next_scheduled_run TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

Add video_review_queue table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE video_review_queue (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  video_url TEXT NOT NULL,
  title TEXT,
  instructor TEXT,
  quality_score DECIMAL,
  analysis_data JSONB,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending', -- pending, approved, rejected
  reviewed_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  reviewed_at TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

1. API ENDPOINTS:

GET /api/admin/curation/settings

- Returns current curation settings

PATCH /api/admin/curation/settings

- Updates curation settings
- Body: { automatic_curation_enabled, manual_review_enabled, quality_threshold }

POST /api/admin/curation/run

- Manually triggers curation process
- Returns: { videos_analyzed, videos_added, videos_rejected }

GET /api/admin/curation/queue

- Returns videos pending manual review

POST /api/admin/curation/review/:videoId

- Body: { action: ‘approve’ | ‘reject’ }
- Approves or rejects video from queue

1. CURATION LOGIC UPDATES:

When curation runs:

IF automatic_curation_enabled = false:

- Don’t run curation at all
- OR run but don’t add anything

IF manual_review_enabled = true:

- Analyze videos as normal
- Add high-scoring videos to review_queue
- Don’t add to main library until approved

IF manual_review_enabled = false:

- Analyze videos
- Auto-add videos scoring >= quality_threshold
- Add to library immediately

1. UI/UX DETAILS:

- Place controls panel ABOVE the video library
- Use purple gradient buttons (match existing design)
- Toggle switches should be clear ON/OFF states
- Slider should update value in real-time
- Show last run time and next scheduled time
- “Run Curation Now” disabled if already running
- Review queue badge shows count (like “Review Queue (5)”)

1. PERMISSIONS:

Only admins can:

- Access /admin/videos
- Change curation settings
- Approve/reject videos
- Manually trigger curation

Regular users cannot access this panel.

IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY:
This is a critical admin feature for controlling the video library growth and quality. Implement immediately.

**That's what's missing! Send that prompt to Replit Agent and you'll get the curation toggle controls you were expecting.** 🎛️​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
