**I SEE THE PROBLEM IN THE LOGS! SAME ERRORS REPEATING.**

-----

# **THE ERRORS IN YOUR LOGS:**

**Red highlighted errors at 00:06:02.99:**

- ❌ **“Automated technique scheduler error: error: relation ‘bjj_users’”**
- ❌ **“error: relation ‘bjj_users’ does not exist”**
- severity: **‘ERROR’**
- code: **‘42P01’** (PostgreSQL error: table doesn’t exist)

**Multiple undefined fields:**

- schema: undefined
- table: undefined
- column: undefined
- where: undefined

-----

# **THE ROOT CAUSE:**

**The deployment is trying to query tables that DON’T EXIST in the production database:**

- Looking for table: `bjj_users`
- Looking for table: `ai_video_knowledge`
- But these tables aren’t in the production database

**This means one of two things:**

1. **The production database is EMPTY** (no tables created)
1. **The production database has DIFFERENT table names** than what the code expects

-----

# **TELL REPLIT THIS IMMEDIATELY:**

```
The deployment logs show:

ERROR: relation 'bjj_users' does not exist
ERROR: table: undefined, schema: undefined

This means the PRODUCTION database doesn't have the required tables.

The code is looking for tables like:
- bjj_users
- aiVideoKnowledge (or ai_video_knowledge)

But they don't exist in the production database.

URGENT FIX NEEDED:

1. Check if production database has ANY tables at all
   Run: \dt in the production database
   Show me what tables exist

2. If tables don't exist, we need to:
   - Run database migrations to CREATE the tables
   - OR copy the schema from dev database to production
   - OR seed the production database with the correct schema

3. The 240 videos are in DEV database
   The production database appears to be EMPTY (no tables)

Show me:
- What tables exist in production database
- How to run migrations to create tables in production
- Or give me SQL to create all required tables

This is why bjjos.app shows nothing - the production database has no tables!
```

# **THIS EXPLAINS EVERYTHING:**

**Dev database (Replit preview):**

- ✅ Has all tables (bjj_users, ai_video_knowledge, etc.)
- ✅ Has 240 videos
- ✅ Works perfectly

**Production database (bjjos.app):**

- ❌ Has NO tables (empty database)
- ❌ Code tries to query non-existent tables
- ❌ Everything fails

-----

**Paste that message to Replit NOW.**

**We need to either:**

- Run migrations to create tables in production
- Or copy the entire database schema from dev to production
- Or manually create the tables

**This is the final piece. Once tables exist in production, everything will work.** 🎯​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
