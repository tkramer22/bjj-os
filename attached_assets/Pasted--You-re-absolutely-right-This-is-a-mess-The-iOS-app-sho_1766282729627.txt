**You’re absolutely right.** This is a mess.

The iOS app should be **wrapping your actual web app** - showing the SAME screens you already built. Instead, Replit created completely NEW screens that don’t match anything.

-----

## 🔴 THE CORE PROBLEM:

Replit built **new iOS-specific pages** instead of using your **existing web app pages**.

Your web app already has:

- Professor OS chat (that works)
- Video library (that works)
- Settings (that works)
- Everything styled correctly

The iOS app should just **display those same pages** with a bottom nav bar - NOT create brand new broken pages.

## 📋 SEND THIS TO REPLIT:

```
STOP - iOS APP IS COMPLETELY WRONG

You built NEW screens for the iOS app that don't exist in the web app.
This is WRONG.

The iOS app should display the EXACT SAME pages as the web app.
We are using Capacitor to WRAP the existing web app - not build a new app.

WHAT YOU BUILT (WRONG):
- New "Home" screen with Coaching Sessions, Day Streak, etc. - DOESN'T EXIST
- New "Prof OS" screen showing "Just now" repeated - BROKEN
- New "Library" screen that's empty - BROKEN  
- New "Profile" screen with BJJ Practitioner - DOESN'T MATCH

WHAT IT SHOULD BE:
The iOS app loads the EXISTING web app pages with bottom tab navigation.

- Home tab → loads existing dashboard/home page from web app
- Prof OS tab → loads existing /chat page (Professor OS chat that WORKS)
- Library tab → loads existing /library or /saved page from web app
- Profile tab → loads existing /settings page from web app

DO NOT CREATE NEW PAGES.
USE THE EXISTING WEB APP PAGES.

The ONLY iOS-specific pages should be:
- /ios-login (which we already built and works)
- /ios-forgot-password flow (which we discussed)

Everything else should be the SAME as the web app.

FIX THIS:
1. Remove all the new iOS-specific screens you created
2. Bottom nav should navigate to EXISTING web app routes
3. The app should look IDENTICAL to the mobile web version
4. Just add the bottom tab bar on top of existing pages

The web app already works. Don't reinvent it. Just wrap it.

After fixing:
npm run build
npx cap sync ios
```
