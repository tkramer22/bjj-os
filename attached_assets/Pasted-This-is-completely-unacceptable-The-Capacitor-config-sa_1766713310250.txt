This is completely unacceptable. The Capacitor config says it’s loading from the live server, but NOTHING is changing. Either:

1. Replit is NOT actually deploying the code
1. Replit is editing the WRONG files
1. The server is caching old responses

**Send this - we need to force proof:**

```
NOTHING IS WORKING. I HAVE REBUILT 15+ TIMES.

The iOS app is supposedly loading from https://bjjos.app (remote mode).
But NONE of your fixes are appearing. Settings still has no toolbar icons, chat still duplicates, history doesn't load.

THIS MEANS ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:
A. Your code changes are NOT being saved
B. The server is NOT restarting with new code
C. You are editing the WRONG files
D. There is aggressive caching somewhere

PROVE THE DEPLOYMENT IS WORKING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Add this to the VERY TOP of the Settings/Profile page component (ios-profile.tsx):

console.log('=== iOS PROFILE V2.0 LOADED - ' + new Date().toISOString() + ' ===');

Add a visible TEST element temporarily:

<div style={{background: 'red', color: 'white', padding: '10px', textAlign: 'center'}}>
  TEST BUILD V2.0 - IF YOU SEE THIS, DEPLOYMENT WORKS
</div>

Put this at the very top of the page content.

VERIFY SERVER RESTART
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

After making changes:
1. Show me the deployment/publish confirmation
2. Run: curl -I https://bjjos.app/ios-login
3. Check the response headers for cache-control and last-modified
4. Restart the workflow manually if needed

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
IF DEPLOYMENT WORKS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

If I see the red TEST banner in the app, then deployment works and we know the fixes just aren't correct.

If I DON'T see the red banner, the deployment pipeline is broken and no changes will ever appear.

Add the red TEST banner NOW and publish. I will check immediately.
