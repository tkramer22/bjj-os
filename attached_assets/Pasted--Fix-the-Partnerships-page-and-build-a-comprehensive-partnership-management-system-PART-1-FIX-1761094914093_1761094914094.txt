Fix the Partnerships page and build a comprehensive partnership management system:

PART 1 - FIX THE BLACK SCREEN BUG:

1. DEBUG "ADD PARTNERSHIP" BUTTON:
The black screen is likely caused by:
- Missing modal component
- Broken JavaScript rendering
- API endpoint not responding
- Missing instructor data to populate dropdown

Fix by:
- Ensure modal component exists and renders properly
- Add error handling and loading states
- Test API endpoint /api/admin/instructors/list
- Add fallback UI if data fails to load

2. CREATE FUNCTIONAL "ADD PARTNERSHIP" MODAL:
When admin clicks "Add Partnership", show modal:

┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

PART 5 - PARTNERSHIP WORKFLOW AUTOMATION:

1. ONBOARDING CHECKLIST:
When partnership is created:
☐ Send welcome email/SMS to partner
☐ Grant lifetime free access to their account
☐ Add partnership badge to their instructor profile
☐ Boost their videos in recommendations (per settings)
☐ Add to homepage "Featured Instructors" (if enabled)
☐ Set calendar reminder to check in (30 days)

2. ONGOING MANAGEMENT:
- Monthly email: "JT Torres partnership performance this month"
- Quarterly review: Analytics summary
- Auto-alerts: "JT Torres uploaded new video - curate it?"

3. EXPIRATION HANDLING:
If partnership has end date:
- 30 days before: "JT Torres partnership expires in 30 days. Renew?"
- 7 days before: Reminder
- On expiration: Auto-downgrade promotion levels
- Post-expiration: "Partnership with JT Torres expired. Archive or renew?"

PART 6 - TRUST-BASED RESULTS TRACKING:

The system focuses on RESULTS, not micromanaging partner activities:

What you track:
✅ Are their videos performing well? (views, helpful rate)
✅ Are users engaging with their content? (saves, follows)
✅ Is the partnership valuable? (ROI calculation)
✅ Should you continue promoting them? (performance trends)

What you DON'T track:
❌ Individual social media posts
❌ Post schedules or quotas
❌ UTM parameters or click tracking
❌ Content calendars

Philosophy: Trust partners to promote organically. Measure only what matters: content performance and user engagement.

Make partnerships a strategic growth tool that's easy to manage, trust-based, and focused on results.
