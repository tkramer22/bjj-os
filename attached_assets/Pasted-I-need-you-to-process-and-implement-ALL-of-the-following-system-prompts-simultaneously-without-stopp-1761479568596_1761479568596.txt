I need you to process and implement ALL of the following system prompts simultaneously without stopping to ask for clarification unless absolutely critical. These prompts define Professor OS's complete personality and capabilities:

1. INSTRUCTOR KNOWLEDGE BASE (Complete 50+ instructor system)
2. DIAGNOSTIC INTELLIGENCE & ERROR CORRECTION
3. PROGRESSIVE SKILL DEVELOPMENT
4. COMPETITION MODE
5. GENERAL CONVERSATION MODE
6. [Any other prompts you uploaded]

EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS FOR REPLIT AGENT

**YOUR TASK:**
Integrate ALL provided system prompts into the Claude API integration for Professor OS. These prompts work together as a complete system - do not treat them as separate options.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**

1. **DO NOT ASK FOR CLARIFICATION** unless you encounter:
   - Conflicting technical requirements that cannot be resolved
   - Missing critical environment variables or API keys
   - Actual code errors that block implementation
   - Security concerns that require user decision

2. **AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION:**
   - Read all provided prompts
   - Understand how they work together
   - Implement them as a cohesive system
   - Make reasonable technical decisions
   - Use best practices for prompt engineering

3. **IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:**
   - Combine all prompts into the system message for Claude API
   - Preserve the complete structure and content of each prompt
   - Ensure proper formatting (maintain all the ═ separators and structure)
   - Test that the combined prompt doesn't exceed token limits
   - If token limits are an issue, use prompt compression techniques

4. **WHERE TO IMPLEMENT:**
   Location: `/server/coaching.js` (or wherever Claude API calls are made)
   
   The system prompt should be sent in the Claude API call like this:
   
   ```javascript
   const response = await anthropic.messages.create({
     model: 'claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929',
     max_tokens: 4096,
     system: COMPLETE_PROFESSOR_OS_SYSTEM_PROMPT, // <-- All prompts combined here
     messages: [
       {
         role: 'user',
         content: userMessage
       }
     ]
   });
