iOS APP - TWO CRITICAL FIXES FOR APP STORE APPROVAL

Apple rejected the app for two issues. Both must be fixed before resubmission.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
FIX 1: PROFILE PHOTO CRASH (Guideline 2.1 - Performance)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The app crashes when user tries to upload a profile photo.

CRASH STEPS (from Apple):
1. Log in to the app
2. Tap on 'Profile'
3. Tap on camera icon on the profile photo
4. Tap on 'Choose from Library' or 'Take Photo'
5. App crashes

DEVICE: iPad Air 11-inch (M3), iPadOS 26.2

FIX REQUIRED:

1. CHECK Info.plist has these permissions:
   - NSCameraUsageDescription (camera access)
   - NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription (photo library access)
   - NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription (save to photo library)

2. ADD proper permission handling:
   - Request permission BEFORE accessing camera/library
   - Handle permission denied gracefully (show alert, don't crash)
   - Handle user cancellation gracefully

3. FIX the image picker implementation:
   - Ensure Capacitor Camera plugin is properly installed
   - Handle all error cases (no camera on device, permission denied, user cancelled)
   - Test on iPad specifically (Apple tested on iPad Air)

4. ADD try/catch around camera/photo code to prevent crashes

Show me the current profile photo code and the fix.

FIX 2: REMOVE ALL WEB SUBSCRIPTION REFERENCES (Guideline 3.1.1 - IAP)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Apple rejected because: "Your app accesses digital content purchased outside the app, such as Video Library subscriptions, but that content isn't available to purchase using in-app purchase."

The iOS app must use Apple IAP as the ONLY subscription method. Remove all references to subscribing elsewhere.

SEARCH AND REMOVE from iOS app:
- Any mention of "bjjos.app" related to subscribing or payments
- Any mention of "Stripe"
- Any "subscribe on web" or "subscribe on website" text
- Any external links for payment/subscription
- Any text suggesting users can pay outside the app

KEEP:
- Apple IAP subscription flow (this is correct)
- Login functionality (web subscribers can still log in)
- The pricing text we added ($19.99/month)

CHECK THESE FILES specifically:
- ios-login.tsx
- ios-signup.tsx  
- ios-profile.tsx
- Any subscription/paywall screens
- Settings page
- Any onboarding screens

The message to users should be:
- New users: Subscribe via Apple ($19.99/month)
- No mention of alternatives

DO NOT affect the web app - only the iOS app.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
AFTER FIXES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. Test profile photo on iPad simulator specifically
2. Verify no web subscription references remain in iOS
3. Show me what was changed before publishing

These fixes are required for App Store approval.
