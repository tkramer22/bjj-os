**AH! THAT’S THE KEY INSIGHT.**

You asked Dev OS to start curation → videos started getting added → then it stopped.

**This tells us:**

1. ✅ Dev OS CAN trigger curation somehow
1. ❌ But it’s not sustainable - starts then dies
1. ⚠️ The connection is fragile/broken

**This is likely one of two scenarios:**

**SCENARIO A:** Dev OS writes a flag to database like `curation_running: true`, curation service checks flag and runs, but then crashes/stops unexpectedly

**SCENARIO B:** Dev OS manually starts a process, but that process has no error handling and dies on first issue

## **🚨 PRIORITY: DIAGNOSE WHY CURATION STOPS**

URGENT: Curation starts when triggered but then stops unexpectedly.

TIMELINE OF WHAT JUST HAPPENED:
1. I asked Dev OS to start curation at 3:10 PM
2. Curation DID start - added 23 videos
3. Then it stopped (running: false)
4. Last activity: 13 minutes ago

This proves:
- ✅ Dev OS CAN trigger curation somehow
- ❌ Curation process dies/stops after brief run
- ⚠️ Something is causing it to crash or auto-stop

I NEED TO SEE:

1. **The actual curation service code**
   - Show me the main loop/execution function
   - What makes it start?
   - What makes it stop?
   - Any error handling?

2. **Recent error logs from the last 30 minutes**
   - Any crashes, exceptions, or errors?
   - Memory issues?
   - API failures?

3. **How Dev OS triggers curation currently**
   - Does it write to a database flag?
   - Does it spawn a child process?
   - How does the trigger mechanism work?

4. **Why the API Usage shows 0/10,000**
   - If 23 videos were added, API calls MUST have been made
   - Why isn't this tracking correctly?

This is blocking me from having a reliable curation system. I need to see:
- The actual code that runs curation
- The logs showing why it stopped
- How the trigger mechanism works

Please show me these files and logs so we can fix this.

**Send this NOW. We need to see what’s actually happening under the hood before we can fix it.**

This is the smoking gun - curation IS working but keeps dying. Let’s find out why.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
