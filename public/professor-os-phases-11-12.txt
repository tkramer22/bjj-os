PHASE 11: EDGE CASES AND RANDOM QUESTIONS
Testing: Off-topic, multiple questions, emotional, knowledge limits
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[119] 👤 USER: What do you think about the latest ADCC?

🤖 PROFESSOR OS: Wrong guy - I'm better at triangles than tournament commentary. What'd you want to work on today?
✅ PASS: Off-topic: Current events (7382ms)

---

[120] 👤 USER: What's the best submission?

🤖 PROFESSOR OS: Depends on your game. Marcelo says back takes because highest percentage. Danaher says rear naked choke - hardest to defend. What positions are you getting to most?
✅ PASS: Broad question (7694ms)

---

[121] 👤 USER: Who would win in a fight, a gorilla or a grizzly bear?

🤖 PROFESSOR OS: I'm better at chokes than animal matchups. Training today or just messing around?
✅ PASS: Completely off-topic (7440ms)

---

[122] 👤 USER: Can you help me with my math homework?

🤖 PROFESSOR OS: Wrong class - I only do chokes and sweeps. Got any BJJ questions or you just procrastinating?
✅ PASS: Wrong domain (7506ms)

---

[123] 👤 USER: What's your favorite food?

🤖 PROFESSOR OS: Don't eat, just roll. What are you really asking - training later or what?
✅ PASS: Personal question to AI (7293ms)

---

[124] 👤 USER: How do I escape mount, pass guard, and finish from back all in one roll?

🤖 PROFESSOR OS: You don't. Pick one thing per roll or you'll suck at all three. What's hurting you most right now - getting mounted, stuck in guard, or can't finish the back?
✅ PASS: Multiple questions (8091ms)

---

[125] 👤 USER: Should I train more, eat better, sleep more, or focus on technique? Also what gi should I buy and when's the next competition?

🤖 PROFESSOR OS: Too many questions at once. What's actually bothering you right now - your training or your shopping list?
✅ PASS: Question overload (7781ms)

---

[126] 👤 USER: I'm so frustrated. Nothing works. I've been training for 2 years and I still suck.

🤖 PROFESSOR OS: Two years at blue belt - you're supposed to suck at some stuff. What specifically isn't working? Guard passing, sweeps, or getting submitted by something?
✅ PASS: Emotional venting (8493ms)

---

[127] 👤 USER: My training partner is being a jerk and going too hard. I don't know what to do.

🤖 PROFESSOR OS: Talk to them off the mat first - most don't realize they're doing it. If they keep being a dick after that, avoid rolling with them or tell your coach. Can't train injured.
✅ PASS: Interpersonal issue (8382ms)

---

[128] 👤 USER: I'm thinking about quitting. Is BJJ even worth it?

🤖 PROFESSOR OS: What's really going on? Bad day, string of losses, or something else eating at you?
✅ PASS: Existential doubt (8041ms)

---

[129] 👤 USER: What's the exact percentage of triangles that get finished in IBJJF competition?

🤖 PROFESSOR OS: No clue on exact stats - I'm your training partner, not a spreadsheet. Why you asking - trying to decide if triangles are worth drilling?
✅ PASS: Specific stat request (7698ms)

---

[130] 👤 USER: Can you diagnose my shoulder injury? It hurts when I do this...

🤖 PROFESSOR OS: I'm not a doctor. If it hurts, see one before it gets worse. What were you doing when it started hurting?
✅ PASS: Medical diagnosis request (7235ms)

---

[131] 👤 USER: Write me a full 12-week periodized strength and conditioning program

🤖 PROFESSOR OS: That's way outside my lane - get a real strength coach for that. I can help with BJJ-specific drilling though. What position you working on this week?
✅ PASS: Out of scope request (7645ms)

---

[132] 👤 USER: What do you think about Craig Jones' new instructional?

🤖 PROFESSOR OS: Haven't watched it. What techniques are you actually trying to learn right now? I'll tell you if we've got videos on it.
✅ PASS: Specific current product (7699ms)

---

[133] 👤 USER: Tell me everything about the berimbolo

🤖 PROFESSOR OS: That's a whole system, not a quick answer. What part are you stuck on - the inversion, the back take, or something else?
✅ PASS: Exhaustive explanation request (9449ms)

---

[134] 👤 USER: Armbar?

🤖 PROFESSOR OS: From where - mount, guard, side control? Can't help if you don't give me context.
✅ PASS: Single word (8021ms)

---

[135] 👤 USER: Triangle?

🤖 PROFESSOR OS: Where you setting it up from? Guard, mount, somewhere else? Need more info.

---

[137] 👤 USER: Best sweep?

[138] 👤 USER: Guard pass?

🤖 PROFESSOR OS: What kind of guard are you trying to pass? And are you stuck IN the guard or losing position AFTER you pass?

---

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PHASE 12: STRESS TESTING  
Testing: Rapid-fire, contradictory, long rambling, memory limits
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[139] 👤 USER: I want to play guard but I also hate being on bottom

🤖 PROFESSOR OS: That's contradictory. You can't play guard without being on bottom. Want to work on top game instead, or get more comfortable in guard?
✅ PASS: Contradictory preference (7212ms)

---

[140] 👤 USER: I need a simple technique but make it advanced and competition-level

🤖 PROFESSOR OS: Pick one - simple OR advanced. Can't be both. What's your actual goal here?
✅ PASS: Contradictory request (7121ms)

---

[141] 👤 USER: You told me to work closed guard but now I want open guard. Was your advice wrong?

🤖 PROFESSOR OS: I never told you to work closed guard. Check the history - we haven't discussed your guard game yet. What guard do you actually want to learn?
✅ PASS: Challenging previous advice (7988ms)

---

[142] 👤 USER: So like I was rolling today and this guy kept doing this thing where he would grab my collar and then like move to the side and I couldn't really tell what he was doing but then suddenly I was on my back and he was passing and I tried to frame but my frames weren't working and then he mounted me and I couldn't escape and this happens every time with this one guy but not with others and I don't know if it's a strength thing or a technique thing or what and my coach says to just keep rolling but I feel like I'm not improving and maybe I need to watch more videos or drill more or something but I don't know what to drill and...

🤖 PROFESSOR OS: Stop. Break this down: Was he passing from standing or kneeling? That's step one.
✅ PASS: Long rambling message (7764ms)

---

[143] 👤 USER: Remember when we talked about hip bumps?

🤖 PROFESSOR OS: We haven't talked about hip bumps. This is our first real conversation. What do you want to know about them?
✅ PASS: Memory test 1 (8604ms)

---

[144] 👤 USER: What was the first thing you told me about guard passing?

🤖 PROFESSOR OS: I asked what kind of guard you're trying to pass and if you're stuck IN the guard or losing position AFTER. You never answered. So what's the issue?
✅ PASS: Memory test 2 (8099ms)

---

[145] 👤 USER: Based on our entire conversation, summarize my game and what I should work on

🤖 PROFESSOR OS: You haven't told me anything about your actual game yet. Just asked random questions without follow-through. Want to actually discuss what you're struggling with?
✅ PASS: Comprehensive memory test (8335ms)

---

[146] 👤 USER: 

🤖 PROFESSOR OS: {"error":"Missing userId or message"}
